          <p id="p_000033">
            <em id="em_000003" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#em_000003">It is customary to begin the study of short stories with the element of plot. Plot is the organized pattern of events in a story. Sometimes the plot is relatively simple and straightforward, as in "The Most Dangerous Game." Sometimes the plot is more complicated; there may be more than one action to follow. Occasionally, a plot is constructed to lead to an ingenious surprise at the end, such as the famous surprise ending of "The Gift of the Magi."</em>
          </p>

            <img id="p002-001" src="images/p002-001.jpg" alt="" />
          </p>
          <p id="p_000035">
            <em id="em_000004" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#em_000004">In some stories, plot is the most important element. Readers keep reading to find out what will happen next. But in most stories, the characters are of primary importance. Generally, a story focuses on a main character. Although "Secrets" tells us about the different members of a family, it is Jean who is at the center of the action.</em>
          </p>
          <p id="p_000036">
            <em id="em_000005" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#em_000005">Another element is point of view. Point of view is like the camera in a movie, the lens through which you, the reader, view the action. "Rules of the Game" is told from a first-person point of view, by the central character in the story. Other stories are told from the third-person point of view, as if the action were seen by an objective observer who merely records what happens. Still other stories are told by an omniscient (all-knowing) narrator, who tells not only what happens but what the characters think and feel.</em>
          </p>
          <p id="p_000037">
            <em id="em_000006" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#em_000006">Just as every story has a point of view, so every story has a setting, the time and place of the action. Some settings are strange and exotic, such as Ship-Trap Island in "The Most Dangerous Game." Some settings are familiar, such as the neighborhood in "A Summer's Reading."</em>
          </p>
          <p id="p_000038">
            <em id="em_000007" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#em_000007">Finally, many short stories do more than entertain readers. They also express a theme, an idea about life. Occasionally, a theme is expressed directly through the author's comments, but generally theme is not directly stated-it must be inferred from other elements in the story.</em>
          </p>
          <p id="p_000039">
            <em id="em_000008" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#em_000008">Readers who enter imaginatively into a short story read actively, asking questions as they read and noting their own reactions to characters and events. The better you understand how such elements as plot, character, setting, point of view, and theme work together, the better you will understand and appreciate the author's intent and meaning.</em>

              <p id="p_000041" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000041">Ask questions about unfamiliar words and references. If you are unable to get the meaning of a word from its context, look it up in a standard dictionary or other reference work.</p>

              <p id="p_000042" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000042">Make predictions as you read. Ask yourself, "What will happen next?" Become aware of your response to the plot as it unfolds.</p>

              <p id="p_000046" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000046">Ask yourself about the central idea or theme-the underlying meaning of the work. In reading a story, ask what it shows about human nature. State this central idea in a sentence. For example: People who live in harmony with the natural world accept its difficulties as well as its blessings.</p>

Were they to be that wasteful of the precious hours which never return, they might get a bad name. And to hold coffee parties on Sundays or great Holy Days was out of the question; for then the married women had husband and children at home, which was quite company enough.

            <p id="p_000093" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000093">When she had finished the old hymn-verse she turned and looked at her guests, as if in apology.</p>
            <p id="p_000094" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000094">"You see," she said, "I haven't any better friend than the Sun, and I wanted to give her a party on the day of her eclipse. I felt that we should come together to greet her, when she came out of her darkness."</p>

"She was kind to rich and poor alike, and when she came peeping into the hut on a winter's day, she was as comforting as a glowing fire on the hearth. Just the sight of her smiling face made life worth living, whatever the troubles one had to bear."</p>

          <p id="p_000109" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000109">"What island is it?" Rainsford asked.</p>
          <p id="p_000110" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000110">"The old charts call it 'Ship-Trap Island,'" Whitney replied. "A suggestive name, isn't it? Sailors have a curious dread of the place. I don't know why. Some superstition----"</p>

          <p id="p_000125" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000125">"The place has a reputation-a bad one."</p>
          <p id="p_000126" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000126">"Cannibals?" suggested Rainsford.</p>
          <p id="p_000127" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000127">"Hardly. Even cannibals wouldn't live in such a Godforsaken place. But it's gotten into sailor lore, somehow. Didn't you notice that the crew's nerves seemed a bit jumpy today?"</p>
          <p id="p_000128" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000128">"They were a bit strange, now you mention it. Even Captain Nielsen----"</p>
          <p id="p_000129" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000129">"Yes, even that tough-minded old Swede, who'd go up to the devil himself and ask him for a light. Those fishy blue eyes held a look I never saw there before. All I could get out of him was: 'This place has an evil name among seafaring men, sir.' Then he said to me, very gravely: 'Don't you feel anything?'--as if the air about us was actually poisonous. Now, you mustn't laugh when I tell you this--I did feel something like a sudden chill.</p>
          <p id="p_000130" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000130">"There was no breeze. The sea was as flat as a plate-glass window. We were drawing near the island then. What I felt was a--a mental chill; a sort of sudden dread."</p>
          <p id="p_000131" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000131">"Pure imagination," said Rainsford. "One superstitious sailor can taint the whole ship's company with his fear."</p>
          <p id="p_000132" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000132">"Maybe. But sometimes I think sailors have an extra sense that tells them when they are in danger. Sometimes I think evil is a tangible thing--with wavelengths, just as sound and light have. An evil place can, so to speak, broadcast vibrations of evil. Anyhow, I'm glad we're getting out of this zone. Well, I think I'll turn in now, Rainsford."</p>
          <p id="p_000133" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000133">"I'm not sleepy," said Rainsford. "I'm going to smoke another pipe up on the afterdeck."</p>
          <p id="p_000134" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000134">"Good night, then, Rainsford. See you at breakfast."</p>
          <p id="p_000135" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000135">"Right. Good night, Whitney."</p>
          <p id="p_000136" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000136">There was no sound in the night as Rainsford sat there, but the muffled throb of the engine that drove the yacht swiftly through the darkness, and the swish and ripple of the wash of the propeller.</p>
          <p id="p_000137" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000137">Rainsford, reclining in a steamer chair, indolently puffed on his favorite brier. The sensuous drowsiness of the night was on him. "It's so dark," he thought, "that I could sleep without closing my eyes; the night would be my eyelids----"</p>
          <p id="p_000138" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000138">An abrupt sound startled him. Off to the right he heard it, and his ears, expert in such matters, could not be mistaken. Again he heard the sound, and again. Somewhere, off in the blackness, someone had fired a gun three times.</p>
          <p id="p_000139" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000139">Rainsford sprang up and moved quickly to the rail, mystified. He strained his eyes in the direction from which the reports had come, but it was like trying to see through a blanket. He leaped upon the rail and balanced himself there, to get greater elevation; his pipe, striking a rope, was knocked from his mouth. He lunged for it; a short, hoarse cry came from his lips as he realized he had reached too far and had lost his balance. The cry was pinched off short as the blood-warm waters of the Caribbean Sea closed over his head.</p>
          <p id="p_000140">
            <span class="text" id="span_000083" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#span_000083">He struggled up to the surface and tried to cry out, but the wash from the speeding yacht slapped him in the face and the salt water in his open mouth made him gag and strangle. Desperately he struck out with strong strokes after the receding lights of the yacht, but he stopped before he had swum fifty feet.</span>
            <pagenum id="p14" page="normal" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p14">14</pagenum>
            <span class="text" id="span_000084" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#span_000084">A certain coolheadedness had come to him; it was not the first time he had been in a tight place. There was a chance that his cries could be heard by someone aboard the yacht, but that chance was slender, and grew more slender as the yacht raced on. He wrestled himself out of his clothes, and shouted with all his power. The lights of the yacht became faint and ever-vanishing fireflies; then they were blotted out entirely by the night.</span>
          </p>
          <p id="p_000141" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000141">Rainsford remembered the shots. They had come from the right, and doggedly he swam in that direction, swimming with slow, deliberate strokes, conserving his strength. For a seemingly endless time he fought the sea. He began to count his strokes; he could do possibly a hundred more and then----</p>
          <p id="p_000142" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000142">Rainsford heard a sound. It came out of the darkness, a high screaming sound, the sound of an animal in an extremity of anguish and terror.</p>
          <p id="p_000143" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000143">He did not recognize the animal that made the sound; he did not try to; with fresh vitality he swam toward the sound. He heard it again; then it was cut short by another noise, crisp, staccato.</p>
          <p id="p_000144" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000144">"Pistol shot," muttered Rainsford, swimming on.</p>
          <p id="p_000145" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000145">Ten minutes of determined effort brought another sound to his ears--the most welcome he had ever heard--the muttering and growling of the sea breaking on a rocky shore. He was almost on the rocks before he saw them; on a night less calm he would have been shattered against them. With his remaining strength he dragged himself from the swirling waters. Jagged crags appeared to jut up into the opaqueness; he forced himself upward, hand over hand. Gasping, his hands raw, he reached a flat place at the top. Dense jungle came down to the very edge of the cliffs. What perils that tangle of trees and underbrush might hold for him did not concern Rainsford just then. All he knew was that he was safe from his enemy, the sea, and that utter weariness was on him. He flung himself down at the jungle edge and tumbled headlong into the deepest sleep of his life.</p>
          <p id="p_000146" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000146">When he opened his eyes he knew from the position of the sun that it was late in the afternoon. Sleep had given him new vigor; a sharp hunger was picking at him. He looked about him, almost cheerfully.</p>
          <p id="p_000147" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000147">"Where there are pistol shots, there are men. Where there are men, there is food," he thought. But what kind of men, he wondered, in so forbidding a place? An unbroken front of snarled and ragged jungle fringed the shore.</p>
          <p id="p_000148" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000148">He saw no sign of a trail through the closely knit web of weeds and trees; it was easier to go along the shore, and Rainsford floundered along by the water. Not far from where he had landed, he stopped.</p>
          <p id="p_000149" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000149">Some wounded thing, by the evidence a large animal, had thrashed about in the underbrush; the jungle weeds were crushed down and the moss was lacerated; one patch of weeds was stained crimson. A small, glittering object not far away caught Rainsford's eye and he picked it up. It was an empty cartridge.</p>
          <p id="p_000150">
            <span class="text" id="span_000085" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#span_000085">"A twenty-two," he remarked. "That's odd. It must have been a fairly large animal too. The hunter had his nerve to tackle it with a light gun. It's clear that the brute put up a fight. I suppose the first three shots I heard was when the hunter flushed his quarry</span>

He came upon them as he turned a crook in the coastline, and his first thought was that he had come upon a village, for there were many lights.

He let it fall, and it startled him with its booming loudness. He thought he heard steps within; the door remained closed. Again Rainsford lifted the heavy knocker, and let it fall. The door opened then, opened as suddenly as if it were on a spring, and Rainsford stood blinking in the river of glaring gold light that poured out. The first thing Rainsford's eyes discerned was the largest man Rainsford had ever seen--a gigantic creature, solidly made and black-bearded to the waist. In his hand the man held a long-barreled revolver, and he was pointing it straight at Rainsford's heart.</p>

Then Rainsford saw the man's free hand go to his forehead in a military salute, and he saw him click his heels together and stand at attention. Another man was coming down the broad marble steps, an erect, slender man in evening clothes. He advanced to Rainsford and held out his hand.</p>

          <p id="p_000177" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000177">The dining room to which Ivan conducted him was in many ways remarkable. There was a medieval magnificence about it; it suggested a baronial hall of feudal times with its oaken panels, its high ceiling, its vast refectory table where twoscore men could sit down to eat. About the hall were the mounted heads of many animals--lions, tigers, elephants, moose, bears; larger or more perfect specimens Rainsford had never seen. At the great table the general was sitting, alone.</p>
          <p id="p_000178" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000178">"You'll have a cocktail, Mr. Rainsford," he suggested. The cocktail was surpassingly good; and, Rainsford noted, the table appointments were of the finest--the linen, the crystal, the silver, the china.</p>
          <p id="p_000179" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000179">They were eating borsch, the rich, red soup with sour cream so dear to Russian palates. Half apologetically General Zaroff said: "We do our best to preserve the amenities of civilization here. Please forgive any lapses. We are well off the beaten track, you know. Do you think the champagne has suffered from its long ocean trip?"</p>
          <p id="p_000180" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000180">"Not in the least," declared Rainsford. He was finding the general a most thoughtful and affable host, a true cosmopolite. But there was one small trait of the general's that made Rainsford uncomfortable. Whenever he looked up from his plate he found the general studying him, appraising him narrowly.</p>
          <p id="p_000181" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000181">"Perhaps," said General Zaroff, "you were surprised that I recognized your name. You see, I read all books on hunting published in English, French, and Russian. I have but one passion in my life, Mr. Rainsford, and it is the hunt."</p>
          <p id="p_000182" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000182">"You have some wonderful heads here," said Rainsford as he ate a particularly well-cooked filet mignon. "That Cape buffalo is the largest I ever saw."</p>
          <p id="p_000183" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000183">"Oh, that fellow. Yes, he was a monster."</p>
          <p id="p_000184" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000184">"Did he charge you?"</p>
          <p id="p_000185" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000185">"Hurled me against a tree," said the general. "Fractured my skull. But I got the brute."</p>
          <p id="p_000186" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000186">"I've always thought," said Rainsford, "that the Cape buffalo is the most dangerous of all big game."</p>
          <p id="p_000187" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000187">For a moment the general did not reply; he was smiling his curious red-lipped smile. Then he said slowly: "No. You are wrong, sir. The Cape buffalo is not the most dangerous big game." He sipped his wine. "Here in my preserve on this island," he said in the same slow tone, "I hunt more dangerous game."</p>
          <p id="p_000188" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000188">Rainsford expressed his surprise. "Is there big game on this island?"</p>
          <p id="p_000189" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000189">The general nodded. "The biggest."</p>

          <p id="p_000191" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000191">"Oh, it isn't here naturally, of course. I have to stock the island."</p>
          <p id="p_000192" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000192">"What have you imported, general?" Rainsford asked. "Tigers?"</p>
          <p id="p_000193" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000193">The general smiled. "No," he said. "Hunting tigers ceased to interest me some years ago. I exhausted their possibilities, you see. No thrill left in tigers, no real danger. I live for danger, Mr. Rainsford."</p>
          <p id="p_000194" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000194">The general took from his pocket a gold cigarette case and offered his guest a long black cigarette with a silver tip; it was perfumed and gave off a smell like incense.</p>
          <p id="p_000195" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000195">"We will have some capital hunting, you and I," said the general. "I shall be most glad to have your society."</p>
          <p id="p_000196" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000196">"But what game----" began Rainsford.</p>
          <p id="p_000197" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000197">"I'll tell you," said the general. "You will be amused, I know. I think I may say, in all modesty, that I have done a rare thing. I have invented a new sensation. May I pour you another glass of port, Mr. Rainsford?"</p>
          <p id="p_000198" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000198">"Thank you, general."</p>

          <p id="p_000199" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000199">The general filled both glasses, and said: "God makes some men poets. Some He makes kings, some beggars. Me He made a hunter. My hand was made for the trigger, my father said. He was a very rich man with a quarter of a million acres in the Crimea, and he was an ardent sportsman. When I was only five years old he gave me a little gun, specially made in Moscow for me, to shoot sparrows with. When I shot some of his prize turkeys with it, he did not punish me; he complimented me on my marksmanship. I killed my first bear in the Caucasus when I was ten. My whole life has been one prolonged hunt. I went into the army--it was expected of noblemen's sons--and for a time commanded a division of Cossack cavalry, but my real interest was always the hunt. I have hunted every kind of game in every land. It would be impossible for me to tell you how many animals I have killed."</p>

As soon as I recovered I started for the Amazon to hunt jaguars, for I had heard they were unusually cunning. They weren't." The Cossack sighed. "They were no match at all for a hunter with his wits about him, and a high-powered rifle. I was bitterly disappointed. I was lying in my tent with a splitting headache one night when a terrible thought pushed its way into my mind. Hunting was beginning to bore me! And hunting, remember, had been my life.

          <p id="p_000203" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000203">"Yes, that's so," said Rainsford.</p>
          <p id="p_000204" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000204">The general smiled. "I had no wish to go to pieces," he said. "I must do something. Now, mine is an analytical mind, Mr. Rainsford. Doubtless that is why I enjoy the problems of the chase."</p>
          <p id="p_000205" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000205">"No doubt, General Zaroff."</p>
          <p id="p_000206" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000206">"So," continued the general, "I asked myself why the hunt no longer fascinated me. You are much younger than I am, Mr. Rainsford, and have not hunted as much, but you perhaps can guess the answer."</p>
          <p id="p_000207" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000207">"What was it?"</p>
          <p id="p_000208" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000208">"Simply this: hunting had ceased to be what you call 'a sporting proposition.' It had become too easy. I always got my quarry. Always. There is no greater bore than perfection."</p>
          <p id="p_000209" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000209">The general lit a fresh cigarette.</p>
          <p id="p_000210" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000210">"No animal had a chance with me any more. That is no boast; it is a mathematical certainty. The animal had nothing but his legs and his instinct. Instinct is no match for reason. When I thought of this it was a tragic moment for me, I can tell you."</p>
          <p id="p_000211" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000211">Rainsford leaned across the table, absorbed in what his host was saying.</p>
          <p id="p_000212" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000212">"It came to me as an inspiration what I must do," the general went on.</p>
          <p id="p_000213" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000213">"And that was?"</p>
          <p id="p_000214" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000214">The general smiled the quiet smile of one who has faced an obstacle and surmounted it with success. "I had to invent a new animal to hunt," he said.</p>
          <p id="p_000215" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000215">"A new animal? You're joking."</p>
          <p id="p_000216">
            <span class="text" id="span_000115" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#span_000115">"Not at all," said the general. "I never joke about hunting. I needed a new animal. I found one. So I bought this island, built this house,</span>
            <pagenum id="p19" page="normal" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p19">19</pagenum>
            <span class="text" id="span_000116" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#span_000116">and here I do my hunting. The island is perfect for my purposes--there are jungles with a maze of trails in them, hills, swamps----"</span>
          </p>
          <p id="p_000217" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000217">"But the animal, General Zaroff?"</p>
          <p id="p_000218" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000218">"Oh," said the general, "it supplies me with the most exciting hunting in the world. No other hunting compares with it for an instant. Every day I hunt, and I never grow bored now, for I have a quarry with which I can match my wits."</p>
          <p id="p_000219" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000219">Rainsford's bewilderment showed in his face.</p>
          <p id="p_000220" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000220">"I wanted the ideal animal to hunt," explained the general. "So, I said: 'What are the attributes of an ideal quarry?' And the answer was, of course: 'It must have courage, cunning, and, above all, it must be able to reason.'"</p>
          <p id="p_000221" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000221">"But no animal can reason," objected Rainsford.</p>
          <p id="p_000222" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000222">"My dear fellow," said the general, "there is one that can."</p>
          <p id="p_000223" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000223">"But you can't mean----" gasped Rainsford.</p>
          <p id="p_000224" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000224">"And why not?"</p>
          <p id="p_000225" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000225">"I can't believe you are serious, General Zaroff. This is a grisly joke."</p>
          <p id="p_000226" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000226">"Why should I not be serious? I am speaking of hunting."</p>
          <p id="p_000227" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000227">"Hunting? General Zaroff, what you speak of is murder."</p>
          <p id="p_000228" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000228">The general laughed with entire good nature. He regarded Rainsford quizzically. "I refuse to believe that so modern and civilized a young man as you seem to be harbors romantic ideas about the value of human life. Surely your experiences in the war----"</p>
          <p id="p_000229" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000229">"Did not make me condone cold-blooded murder," finished Rainsford stiffly.</p>
          <p id="p_000230" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000230">Laughter shook the general. "How extraordinarily droll you are!" he said. "One does not expect nowadays to find a young man of the educated class, even in America, with such a naive, and, if I may say so, mid-Victorian point of view. It's like finding a snuffbox in a limousine. Ah, well, doubtless you had Puritan ancestors. So many Americans appear to have had. I'll wager you'll forget your notions when you go hunting with me. You've a genuine new thrill in store for you, Mr. Rainsford."</p>
          <p id="p_000231" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000231">"Thank you, I'm a hunter, not a murderer."</p>
          <p id="p_000232" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000232">"Dear me," said the general, quite unruffled. "Again that unpleasant word. But I think I can show you that your scruples are quite ill-founded."</p>
          <p id="p_000233" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000233">"Yes?"</p>
          <p id="p_000234" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000234">"Life is for the strong, to be lived by the strong, and, if need be, taken by the strong. The weak of the world were put here to give the strong pleasure. I am strong. Why should I not use my gift? If I wish to hunt, why should I not? I hunt the scum of the earth-sailors from tramp ships--lascars, blacks, Chinese, whites, mongrels--a thoroughbred horse or hound is worth more than a score of them."</p>
          <p id="p_000235" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000235">"But they are men," said Rainsford hotly.</p>
          <p id="p_000236" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000236">"Precisely," said the general. "That is why I use them. It gives me pleasure. They can reason, after a fashion. So they are dangerous."</p>
          <p id="p_000237" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000237">"But where do you get them?"</p>
          <p id="p_000238" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000238">The general's left eyelid fluttered down in a wink. "This island is called Ship-Trap," he answered. "Sometimes an angry god of the high seas sends them to me. Sometimes, when Providence is not so kind, I help Providence a bit. Come to the window with me."</p>
          <p id="p_000239" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000239">Rainsford went to the window and looked out toward the sea.</p>
          <p id="p_000240" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000240">"Watch! Out there!" exclaimed the general, pointing into the night. Rainsford's eyes saw only blackness, and then, as the general pressed a button, far out to sea Rainsford saw the flash of lights.</p>
          <p id="p_000241">
            <span class="text" id="span_000117" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#span_000117">The general chuckled. "They indicate a channel," he said, "where there's none: giant rocks with razor edges crouch like a sea monster</span>
            <pagenum id="p20" page="normal" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p20">20</pagenum>
            <span class="text" id="span_000118" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#span_000118">with wide-open jaws. They can crush a ship as easily as I crush this nut." He dropped a walnut on the hardwood floor and brought his heel grinding down on it. "Oh, yes," he said, casually, as if in answer to a question, "I have electricity. We try to be civilized here."</span>
          </p>
          <p id="p_000242" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000242">"Civilized? And you shoot down men?"</p>
          <p id="p_000243" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000243">A trace of anger was in the general's black eyes, but it was there for but a second, and he said, in his most pleasant manner: "Dear me, what a righteous young man you are! I assure you I do not do the thing you suggest. That would be barbarous. I treat these visitors with every consideration. They get plenty of good food and exercise. They get into splendid physical condition. You shall see for yourself tomorrow."</p>
          <p id="p_000244" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000244">"What do you mean?"</p>
          <p id="p_000245">
            <span class="text" id="span_000119" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#span_000119">"We'll visit my training school," smiled the general. "It's in the cellar. I have about a dozen pupils down there now. They're from the Spanish bark</span>

          <p id="p_000246" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000246">He raised his hand, and Ivan, who served as waiter, brought thick Turkish coffee. Rainsford, with an effort, held his tongue in check.</p>
          <p id="p_000247" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000247">"It's a game, you see," pursued the general blandly. "I suggest to one of them that we go hunting. I give him a supply of food and an excellent hunting knife. I give him three hours' start. I am to follow, armed only with a pistol of the smallest caliber and range. If my quarry eludes me for three whole days, he wins the game. If I find him"--the general smiled--"he loses."</p>
          <p id="p_000248" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000248">"Suppose he refuses to be hunted?"</p>
          <p id="p_000249">
            <span class="text" id="span_000121" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#span_000121">"Oh," said the general, "I give him his option, of course. He need not play that game if he doesn't wish to. If he does not wish to hunt, I turn him over to Ivan. Ivan once had the honor of serving as official knouter</span>

          <p id="p_000251" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000251">"And if they win?"</p>
          <p id="p_000252" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000252">The smile on the general's face widened. "To date I have not lost," he said.</p>
          <p id="p_000253" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000253">Then he added, hastily: "I don't wish you to think me a braggart, Mr. Rainsford. Many of them afford only the most elementary sort of problem. Occasionally I strike a tartar. One almost did win. I eventually had to use the dogs."</p>
          <p id="p_000254" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000254">"The dogs?"</p>
          <p id="p_000255" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000255">"This way, please. I'll show you."</p>
          <p id="p_000256" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000256">The general steered Rainsford to a window. The lights from the windows sent a flickering illumination that made grotesque patterns on the courtyard below, and Rainsford could see moving about there a dozen or so huge black shapes; as they turned toward him, their eyes glittered greenly.</p>
          <p id="p_000257" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000257">"A rather good lot, I think," observed the general. "They are let out at seven every night. If anyone should try to get into my house--or out of it--something extremely regrettable would occur to him." He hummed a snatch of song from the Folies BergÃ¨re.</p>
          <p id="p_000258" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000258">"And now," said the general, "I want to show you my new collection of heads. Will you come with me to the library?"</p>
          <p id="p_000259" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000259">"I hope," said Rainsford, "that you will excuse me tonight, General Zaroff. I'm really not feeling at all well."</p>
          <p id="p_000260" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000260">"Ah, indeed?" the general inquired solicitously. "Well, I suppose that's only natural, after your long swim. You need a good, restful night's sleep. Tomorrow you'll feel like a new man, I'll wager. Then we'll hunt, eh? I've one rather promising prospect----"</p>
          <p id="p_000261" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000261">Rainsford was hurrying from the room.</p>
          <pagenum id="p21" page="normal" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p21">21</pagenum>
          <p id="p_000262" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000262">"Sorry you can't go with me tonight," called the general. "I expect rather fair sport-a big, strong fellow. He looks resourceful----Well, good night, Mr. Rainsford; I hope you have a good night's rest."</p>
          <p id="p_000263" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000263">The bed was good, and the pajamas of the softest silk, and he was tired in every fiber of his being, but nevertheless Rainsford could not quiet his brain with the opiate of sleep. He lay, eyes wide open. Once he thought he heard stealthy steps in the corridor outside his room. He sought to throw open the door; it would not open. He went to the window and looked out. His room was high up in one of the towers. The lights of the chÃ¢teau were out now, and it was dark and silent, but there was a fragment of sallow moon, and by its wan light he could see, dirtily, the courtyard; there, weaving in and out in the pattern of shadow, were black, noiseless forms; the hounds heard him at the window and looked up, expectantly, with their green eyes. Rainsford went back to the bed and lay down. By many methods he tried to put himself to sleep. He had achieved a doze when, just as morning began to come, he heard, far off in the jungle, the faint report of a pistol.</p>
          <p id="p_000264" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000264">General Zaroff did not appear until luncheon. He was dressed faultlessly in the tweeds of a country squire. He was solicitous about the state of Rainsford's health.</p>
          <p id="p_000265" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000265">"As for me," sighed the general, "I do not feel so well. I am worried, Mr. Rainsford. Last night I detected traces of my old complaint."</p>
          <p id="p_000266" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000266">To Rainsford's questioning glance the general said: "Ennui. Boredom."</p>
          <p id="p_000267" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000267">Then, taking a second helping of crÃªpes suzette, the general explained: "The hunting was not good last night. The fellow lost his head. He made a straight trail that offered no problems at all. That's the trouble with these sailors; they have dull brains to begin with, and they do not know how to get about in the woods. They do excessively stupid and obvious things. It's most annoying. Will you have another glass of Chablis, Mr. Rainsford?"</p>
          <p id="p_000268" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000268">"General," said Rainsford firmly, "I wish to leave this island at once."</p>
          <p id="p_000269" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000269">The general raised his thickets of eyebrows; he seemed hurt. "But, my dear fellow," the general protested, "you've only just come. You've had no hunting----"</p>
          <p id="p_000270" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000270">"I wish to go today," said Rainsford. He saw the dead black eyes of the general on him, studying him. General Zaroff s face suddenly brightened.</p>
          <p id="p_000271" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000271">He filled Rainsford's glass with venerable Chablis from a dusty bottle.</p>
          <p id="p_000272" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000272">"Tonight," said the general, "we will hunt--you and I."</p>
          <p id="p_000273" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000273">Rainsford shook his head. "No, general," he said. "I will not hunt."</p>
          <p id="p_000274" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000274">The general shrugged his shoulders and delicately ate a hothouse grape. "As you wish, my friend," he said. "The choice rests entirely with you. But may I not venture to suggest that you will find my idea of sport more diverting than Ivan's?"</p>
          <p id="p_000275" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000275">He nodded toward the corner to where the giant stood, scowling, his thick arms crossed on his hogshead of chest.</p>
          <p id="p_000276" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000276">"You don't mean----" cried Rainsford.</p>
          <p id="p_000277" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000277">"My dear fellow," said the general, "have I not told you I always mean what I say about hunting? This is really an inspiration. I drink to a foeman worthy of my steel--at last."</p>
          <p id="p_000278" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000278">The general raised his glass, but Rainsford sat staring at him.</p>
          <p id="p_000279" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000279">"You'll find this game worth playing," the general said enthusiastically. "Your brain against mine.

          <p id="p_000280" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000280">"And if I win----" began Rainsford huskily.</p>

          <p id="p_000282" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000282">The general read what Rainsford was thinking.</p>
          <p id="p_000283" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000283">"Oh, you can trust me," said the Cossack. "I will give you my word as a gentleman and a sportsman. Of course you, in turn, must agree to say nothing of your visit here."</p>
          <p id="p_000284" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000284">"I'll agree to nothing of the kind," said Rainsford.</p>
          <p id="p_000285" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000285">"Oh," said the general, "in that case----But why discuss that now? Three days hence we can discuss it over a bottle of Veuve Cliquot, unless----"</p>
          <p id="p_000286" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000286">The general sipped his wine.</p>

            <span class="text" id="span_000124" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#span_000124">Then a businesslike air animated him. "Ivan," he said to Rainsford, "will supply you with hunting clothes, food, a knife. I suggest you wear moccasins; they leave a poorer trail. I suggest too that you avoid a big swamp in the southeast corner of the island. We call it Death Swamp. There's quicksand there. One foolish fellow tried it. The deplorable part of it was that Lazarus followed him. You can imagine my feelings, Mr. Rainsford. I loved Lazarus; he was the finest hound in my pack. Well, I must beg you to excuse me now. I always take a siesta after lunch. You'll hardly have time for a nap, I fear. You'll want to start, no doubt. I shall not follow till dusk. Hunting at night is so much more exciting than by day, don't you think? Au revoir,</span>

          <p id="p_000290" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000290">From another door came Ivan. Under one arm he carried khaki hunting clothes, a haversack of food, a leather sheath containing a long-bladed hunting knife; his right hand rested on a cocked revolver thrust in the crimson sash about his waist....</p>
          <p id="p_000291" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000291">Rainsford had fought his way through the bush for two hours. "I must keep my nerve. I must keep my nerve," he said through tight teeth.</p>
          <p id="p_000292" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000292">He had not been entirely clearheaded when the chÃ¢teau gates snapped shut behind him. His whole idea at first was to put distance between himself and General Zaroff, and, to this end, he had plunged along, spurred on by the sharp rowels of something very like panic. Now he had got a grip on himself, had stopped, and was taking stock of himself and the situation.</p>
          <p id="p_000293" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000293">He saw that straight flight was futile; inevitably it would bring him face to face with the sea. He was in a picture with a frame of water, and his operations, clearly, must take place within that frame.</p>

            <span class="text" id="span_000127" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#span_000127">"I'll give him a trail to follow," muttered Rainsford, and he struck off from the rude paths he had been following into the trackless wilderness. He executed a series of intricate loops; he doubled on his trail again and again, recalling all the lore of the fox hunt, and all the dodges of the fox. Night found him leg-weary, with hands and face lashed by the branches, on a thickly wooded ridge. He knew it would be insane to blunder on through the dark, even if he had the strength. His need for rest was imperative and he thought: "I have played the fox, now I must play the cat of the fable." A big tree with a thick trunk and outspread branches was nearby, and, taking care to leave not the slightest mark, he climbed up into the crotch, and stretching out on one of the broad limbs, after a fashion, rested. Rest brought him new confidence and almost a feeling of security. Even so zealous a hunter as General Zaroff could not trace him there, he told himself; only the devil himself could follow that complicated</span>

            <img id="p023-001" src="images/p023-001.jpg" alt="" />
          </p>
          <p id="p_000296" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000296">An apprehensive night crawled slowly by like a wounded snake, and sleep did not visit Rainsford, although the silence of a dead world was on the jungle. Toward morning when a dingy gray was varnishing the sky, the cry of some startled bird focused Rains-ford's attention in that direction. Something was coming through the bush, coming slowly, carefully, coming by the same winding way Rainsford had come. He flattened himself down on the limb, and through a screen of leaves almost as thick as tapestry, he watched. The thing that was approaching was a man.</p>
          <p id="p_000297" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000297">It was General Zaroff. He made his way along with his eyes fixed in utmost concentration on the ground before him. He paused, almost beneath the tree, dropped to his knees and studied the ground. Rainsford's impulse was to hurl himself down like a panther, but he saw that the general's right hand held something metallic--a small automatic pistol.</p>
          <p id="p_000298" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000298">The hunter shook his head several times, as if he were puzzled. Then he straightened up and took from his case one of his black cigarettes; its pungent incenselike smoke floated up to Rainsford's nostrils.</p>
          <pagenum id="p24" page="normal" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p24">24</pagenum>
          <p id="p_000299" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000299">Rainsford held his breath. The general's eyes had left the ground and were traveling inch by inch up the tree. Rainsford froze there, every muscle tensed for a spring. But the sharp eyes of the hunter stopped before they reached the limb where Rainsford lay; a smile spread over his brown face. Very deliberately he blew a smoke ring into the air; then he turned his back on the tree and walked carelessly away, back along the trail he had come. The swish of the underbrush against his hunting boots grew fainter and fainter.</p>
          <p id="p_000300" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000300">The pent-up air burst hotly from Rainsford's lungs. His first thought made him feel sick and numb. The general could follow a trail through the woods at night; he could follow an extremely difficult trail; he must have uncanny powers; only by the merest chance had the Cossack failed to see his quarry.</p>
          <p id="p_000301" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000301">Rainsford's second thought was even more terrible. It sent a shudder of cold horror through his whole being. Why had the general smiled? Why had he turned back?</p>
          <p id="p_000302" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000302">Rainsford did not want to believe what his reason told him was true, but the truth was as evident as the sun that had by now pushed through the morning mists. The general was playing with him! The general was saving him for another day's sport! The Cossack was the cat; he was the mouse. Then it was that Rainsford knew the full meaning of terror.</p>
          <p id="p_000303" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000303">"I will not lose my nerve. I will not."</p>
          <p id="p_000304" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000304">He slid down from the tree, and struck off again into the woods. His face was set and he forced the machinery of his mind to function. Three hundred yards from his hiding place he stopped where a huge dead tree leaned precariously on a smaller, living one. Throwing off his sack of food, Rainsford took his knife from its sheath and began to work with all his energy.</p>
          <p id="p_000305" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000305">The job was finished at last, and he threw himself down behind a fallen log a hundred feet away. He did not have to wait long. The cat was coming again to play with the mouse.</p>
          <p id="p_000306" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000306">Following the trail with the sureness of a bloodhound came General Zaroff. Nothing escaped those searching black eyes, no crushed blade of grass, no bent twig, no mark, no matter how faint, in the moss. So intent was the Cossack on his stalking that he was upon the thing Rainsford had made before he saw it. His foot touched the protruding bough that was the trigger. Even as he touched it, the general sensed his danger and leaped back with the agility of an ape. But he was not quite quick enough; the dead tree, delicately adjusted to rest on the cut living one, crashed down and struck the general a glancing blow on the shoulder as it fell; but for his alertness, he must have been smashed beneath it. He staggered, but he did not fall; nor did he drop his revolver. He stood there, rubbing his injured shoulder, and Rainsford, with fear again gripping his heart, heard the general's mocking laugh ring through the jungle.</p>
          <p id="p_000307" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000307">"Rainsford," called the general, "if you are within sound of my voice, as I suppose you are, let me congratulate you. Not many men know how to make a Malay man-catcher. Luckily, for me, I too have hunted in Malacca. You are proving interesting, Mr. Rainsford. I am going now to have my wound dressed; it's only a slight one. But I shall be back. I shall be back."</p>
          <p id="p_000308">
            <span class="text" id="span_000129" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#span_000129">When the general, nursing his bruised shoulder, had gone, Rainsford took up his flight again. It was flight now, a desperate, hopeless flight, that carried him on for some hours. Dusk came, then darkness, and still he pressed on. The ground grew softer under his moccasins; the vegetation grew ranker, denser; insects bit him savagely. Then, as he stepped forward, his foot sank into the ooze. He tried to wrench it back, but the muck sucked viciously at his foot as if it were a giant leech.</span>
            <pagenum id="p25" page="normal" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p25">25</pagenum>
            <span class="text" id="span_000130" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#span_000130">With a violent effort, he tore his foot loose. He knew where he was now. Death Swamp and its quicksand.</span>
          </p>
          <p id="p_000309" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000309">His hands were tight closed as if his nerve were something tangible that someone in the darkness was trying to tear from his grip. The softness of the earth had given him an idea. He stepped back from the quicksand a dozen feet or so and, like some huge prehistoric beaver, he began to dig.</p>
          <p id="p_000310" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000310">Rainsford had dug himself in in France when a second's delay meant death. That had been a placid pastime compared to his digging now. The pit grew deeper; when it was above his shoulders, he climbed out and from some hard saplings cut stakes and sharpened them to a fine point. These stakes he planted in the bottom of the pit with the points sticking up. With flying fingers he wove a rough carpet of weeds and branches and with it he covered the mouth of the pit. Then, wet with sweat and aching with tiredness, he crouched behind the stump of a lightning-charred tree.</p>
          <p id="p_000311" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000311">He knew his pursuer was coming; he heard the padding sound of feet on the soft earth, and the night breeze brought him the perfume of the general's cigarette. It seemed to Rainsford that the general was coming with unusual swiftness; he was not feeling his way along, foot by foot. Rainsford, crouching there, could not see the general, nor could he see the pit. He lived a year in a minute. Then he felt an impulse to cry aloud with joy, for he heard the sharp crackle of the breaking branches as the cover of the pit gave way; he heard the sharp scream of pain as the pointed stakes found their mark. He leaped up from his place of concealment. Then he cowered back. Three feet from the pit a man was standing, with an electric torch in his hand.</p>
          <p id="p_000312" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000312">"You've done well, Rainsford," the voice of the general called. "Your Burmese tiger pit has claimed one of my best dogs. Again you score. I think, Mr. Rainsford, I'll see what you can do against my whole pack. I'm going home for a rest now. Thank you for a most amusing evening."</p>
          <p id="p_000313" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000313">At daybreak Rainsford, lying near the swamp, was awakened by a sound that made him know that he had new things to learn about fear. It was a distant sound, faint and wavering, but he knew it. It was the baying of a pack of hounds.</p>
          <p id="p_000314" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000314">Rainsford knew he could do one of two things. He could stay where he was and wait. That was suicide. He could flee. That was postponing the inevitable. For a moment he stood there, thinking. An idea that held a wild chance came to him, and tightening his belt, he headed away from the swamp.</p>
          <p id="p_000315" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000315">The baying of the hounds drew nearer, then still nearer, nearer, ever nearer. On a ridge Rainsford climbed a tree. Down a watercourse, not a quarter of a mile away, he could see the bush moving. Straining his eyes, he saw the lean figure of General Zaroff; just ahead of him Rainsford made out another figure whose wide shoulders surged through the tall jungle weeds; it was the giant Ivan, and he seemed pulled forward by some unseen force; Rainsford knew that Ivan must be holding the pack in leash.</p>
          <p id="p_000316" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000316">They would be on him any minute now. His mind worked frantically. He thought of a native trick he had learned in Uganda. He slid down the tree. He caught hold of a springy young sapling and to it he fastened his hunting knife, with the blade pointing down the trail; with a bit of wild grapevine he tied back the sapling. Then he ran for his life. The hounds raised their voices as they hit the fresh scent. Rainsford knew now how an animal at bay feels.</p>
          <p id="p_000317">
            <span class="text" id="span_000131" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#span_000131">He had to stop to get his breath. The baying</span>

            <span class="text" id="span_000132" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#span_000132">of the hounds stopped abruptly, and Rains-ford's heart stopped too. They must have reached the knife.</span>

          <p id="p_000318" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000318">He shinnied excitedly up a tree and looked back. His pursuers had stopped. But the hope that was in Rainsford's brain when he climbed died, for he saw in the shallow valley that General Zaroff was still on his feet. But Ivan was not. The knife, driven by the recoil of the springing tree, had not wholly failed.</p>
          <p id="p_000319" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000319">Rainsford had hardly tumbled to the ground when the pack took up the cry again.</p>
          <p id="p_000320" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00001.smil#p_000320">"Nerve, nerve, nerve!" he panted, as he dashed along. A blue gap showed between the trees dead ahead. Ever nearer drew the hounds. Rainsford forced himself on toward that gap. He reached it. It was the shore of the sea. Across a cove he could see the gloomy gray stone of the chÃ¢teau. Twenty feet below him the sea rumbled and hissed. Rainsford hesitated. He heard the hounds. Then he leaped far out into the sea....</p>

One was the thought that it would be difficult to replace Ivan; the other was that his quarry had escaped him; of course the American hadn't played the game--so thought the general as he tasted his after-dinner liqueur.

          <p id="p_000391" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00002.smil#p_000391">The institution was a very popular one. When the people gathered together on one of the great trial days, they never knew whether they were to witness a bloody slaughter or a hilarious wedding. This element of uncertainty lent an interest to the occasion which it could not otherwise have attained. Thus the masses were entertained and pleased, and the thinking part of the community could bring no charge of unfairness against this plan; for did not the accused person have the whole matter in his own hands?</p>
          <p id="p_000392" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00002.smil#p_000392">This semibarbaric king had a daughter as blooming as his most florid fancies, and with a soul as fervent and imperious as his own. As is usual in such cases, she was the apple of his eye, and was loved by him above all humanity. Among his courtiers was a young man of that fineness of blood and lowness of station common to the conventional heroes of romance who love royal maidens. This royal maiden was well satisfied with her lover, for he was handsome and brave to a degree unsurpassed in all this kingdom; and she loved him with an ardor that had enough of barbarism in it to make it exceedingly warm and strong. This love affair moved on happily for many months, until one day the king happened to discover its existence. He did not hesitate nor waver in regard to his duty in the premises. The youth was immediately cast into prison, and a day was appointed for his trial in the king's arena. This, of course, was an especially important occasion; and his Majesty, as well as all the people, was greatly interested in the workings and development of this trial. Never before had such a case occurred; never before had a subject dared to love the daughter of a king. In after years such things became commonplace enough; but then they were, in no slight degree, novel and startling.</p>

Of course everybody knew that the deed with which the accused was charged had been done. He had loved the princess, and neither he, she, nor anyone else thought of denying the fact; but the king would not think of allowing any fact of this kind to interfere with the workings of the tribunal,</span>

From far and near the people gathered, and thronged the great galleries of the arena; and crowds, unable to gain admittance, massed themselves against its outside walls. The king and his court were in their places, opposite the twin doors-those fateful portals, so terrible in their similarity.</p>
          <p id="p_000396" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00002.smil#p_000396">All was ready. The signal was given. A door beneath the royal party opened, and the lover of the princess walked into the arena. Tall, beautiful, fair, his appearance was greeted with a low hum of admiration and anxiety. Half the audience had not known so grand a youth had lived among them. No wonder the princess loved him! What a terrible thing for him to be there!</p>

From the moment that the decree had gone forth that her lover should decide his fate in the king's arena, she had thought of nothing, night or day, but this great event and the various subjects connected with it. Possessed of more power, influence, and force of character than anyone who had ever before been interested in such a case, she had done what no other person had done-she had possessed herself of the secret of the doors. She knew in which of the two rooms that lay behind those doors stood the cage of the tiger, with its open front, and in which waited the lady. Through these thick doors, heavily curtained with skins on the inside, it was impossible that any noise or suggestion should come from within to the person who should approach to raise the latch of one of them; but gold, and the power of a woman's will, had brought the secret to the princess.</span>

It was one of the fairest and loveliest of the damsels of the court who had been selected as the reward of the accused youth, should he be proved innocent of the crime of aspiring to one so far above him; and the princess hated her. Often had she seen, or imagined that she had seen, this fair creature throwing glances of admiration upon the person of her lover, and sometimes she thought these glances were perceived and even returned. Now and then she had seen them talking together; it was but for a moment or two, but much can be said in a brief space; it may have been on most unimportant topics, but how could she know that? The girl was lovely, but she had dared to raise her eyes to the loved one of the princess; and, with all the intensity of the savage blood transmitted to her through long lines of wholly barbaric ancestors, she hated the woman who blushed and trembled behind that silent door.</p>

He had expected her to know it. He understood her nature, and his soul was assured that she would never rest until she had made plain to herself this thing, hidden to all other lookers-on, even to the king. The only hope for the youth in which there was any element of certainty was based upon the success of the princess in discovering this mystery; and the moment he looked upon her, he saw she had succeeded, as in his soul he knew she would succeed.</span>

It involves a study of the human heart which leads us through devious mazes of passion, out of which it is difficult to find our way. Think of it, fair reader, not as if the decision of the question depended upon yourself, but upon that hot-blooded, semibarbaric princess, her soul at a white heat beneath the combined fires of despair and jealousy.

How in her grievous reveries had she gnashed her teeth and torn her hair when she saw his start of rapturous delight as he opened the door of the lady! How her soul had burned in agony when she had seen him rush to meet that woman, with her flushing cheek and sparkling eye of triumph; when she had seen him lead her forth, his whole frame kindled with the joy of recovered life; when she had heard the glad shouts from the multitude, and the wild ringing of the happy bells; when she had seen the priest, with his joyous followers, advance to the couple, and make them man and wife before her very eyes; and when she had seen them walk away together upon their path of flowers, followed by the tremendous shouts of the hilarious multitude, in which her one despairing shriek was lost and drowned!</p>

At the corner of the barn he saw the intruder, a mere boy of nineteen or twenty for all of his uniform, jump back to escape being run down. At the same moment the roan swerved, and its rider caught a glimpse of the aroused men by the house. Some were springing from their horses, and he could see the rifles going to their shoulders. He passed the kitchen door and the dried corpses swinging in the shade, compelling his foes to run around the front of the house. A rifle cracked, and a second, but he was going fast, leaning forward, low in the saddle, one hand clutching the shirt of apples, the other guiding the horse.</p>

Eight hundred yards straight away were the woods, and the roan was covering the distance with mighty strides. Every man was now firing. They were pumping their guns so rapidly that he no longer heard individual shots. A bullet went through his hat, but he was unaware, though he did know when another tore through the apples on the pommel. And he winced and ducked even lower when a third bullet, fired low, struck a stone between his horse's legs and ricocheted off through the air, buzzing and humming like some incredible insect.</span>

Others were running back behind the house for their horses. As he looked, two, already mounted, came back into view around the corner, riding hard.

By the time he published his first book at the age of twenty-four, he had been a hobo, a longshoreman, an oyster pirate, a seaman, and a gold prospector in Alaska. He had also been in jail twice--once for vagrancy in New York and once for speaking at a socialist meeting in California. London's participation in the gold rush to the Klondike in 1896 paid off--not in gold, but in material for stories. London soon became one of the most highly paid writers in the United States. Disciplined to write a thousand words a day, he turned out popular adventure fiction, such as the famous story "To Build a Fire" and the best-selling novel</span>

He was a well-grown, handsome man, with a splendid forehead, and though he has been with us for twenty years he cannot be more than forty now. With his personal advantages and his extraordinary gifts--for he can speak several languages and play nearly every musical instrument--it is wonderful that he should have been satisfied so long in such a position, but I suppose that he was comfortable and lacked energy to make any change.

A few months ago we were in hopes that he was about to settle down again, for he became engaged to Rachel Howells, our second housemaid; but he has thrown her over since then and taken up with Janet Tregellis, the daughter of the head gamekeeper. Rachel--who is a very good girl, but of an excitable Welsh temperament--had a sharp touch of brain fever and goes about the house now--or did until yesterday--like a black-eyed shadow of her former self. That was our first drama at Hurlstone; but a second one came to drive it from our minds, and it was prefaced by the disgrace and dismissal of butler Brunton.</span>

Over the low, heavy-lintelled door, in the center of this old part, is chiseled the date, 1607, but experts are agreed that the beams and stonework are really much older than this. The enormously thick walls and tiny windows of this part had in the last century driven the family into building the new wing, and the old one was used now as a storehouse and a cellar, when it was used at all.

It was low in the heavens, and I calculated that in less than an hour it would lie just above the topmost branches of the old oak. One condition mentioned in the Ritual would then be fulfilled. And the shadow of the elm must mean the farther end of the shadow, otherwise the trunk would have been chosen as the guide. I had, then, to find where the far end of the shadow would fall when the sun was just clear of the oak."</p>

I went with Musgrave to his study and whittled myself this peg, to which I tied this long string with a knot at each yard. Then I took two lengths of a fishing rod, which came to just six feet, and I went back with my client to where the elm had been. The sun was just grazing the top of the oak. I fastened the rod on end, marked out the direction of the shadow, and measured it. It was nine feet in length.</p>
          <p id="p_000647" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00003.smil#p_000647">"Of course the calculation now was a simple one. If a rod of six feet threw a shadow of nine, a tree of sixty-four feet would throw one of ninety-six, and the line of the one would of course be the line of the other. I measured out the distance, which brought me almost to the wall of the house, and I thrust a peg into the spot. You can imagine my exultation, Watson, when within two inches of my peg I saw a conical depression in the ground. I knew that it was the mark made by Brunton in his measurements, and that I was still upon his trail.</p>

At one side of this was a squat, brass-bound wooden box, the lid of which was hinged upward, with this curious old-fashioned key projecting from the lock. It was furred outside by a thick layer of dust, and damp and worms had eaten through the wood, so that a crop of livid fungi was growing on the inside of it.

The attitude had drawn all the stagnant blood to the face, and no man could have recognized that distorted liver-colored countenance; but his height, his dress, and his hair were all sufficient to show my client, when we had drawn the body up, that it was indeed his missing butler. He had been dead some days, but there was no wound or bruise upon his person to show how he had met his dreadful end.

It was better, if he could, to have his helpmate inside the house. But whom could he ask? This girl had been devoted to him. A man always finds it hard to realize that he may have finally lost a woman's love, however badly he may have treated her. He would try by a few attentions to make his peace with the girl Howells, and then would engage her as his accomplice. Together they would come at night to the cellar, and their united force would suffice to raise the stone. So far I could follow their actions as if I had actually seen them.</span>

            <p id="p_000709" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00003.smil#p_000709">In other stories the framework plays a much more important role. "The Musgrave Ritual," for example, tells two stories that are important. In the framework story, Watson introduces us to Sherlock Holmes, and we listen in on their conversation about Holmes's career. The inner story, about the facts in the case of the Musgrave Ritual, is related by Holmes. The framework story and the story within a story reinforce one another, and each story adds meaning to the other.</p>

"Remember to get those overshoes while I'm having my hair done," she said. "I don't need overshoes," said Mitty. She put her mirror back into her bag. "We've been all through that," she said, getting out of the car. "You're not a young man any longer." He raced the engine a little. "Why don't you wear your gloves? Have you lost your gloves?" Walter Mitty reached in a pocket and brought out the gloves. He put them on, but after she had turned and gone into the building and he had driven on to a red light, he took them off again. "Pick it up, brother!" snapped a cop as the light changed, and Mitty hastily pulled on his gloves and lurched ahead. He drove around the streets aimlessly for a time, and then he drove past the hospital on his way to the parking lot.</p>

"Dr. Renshaw and Dr. Benbow, but there are two specialists here, Dr. Remington from New York and Dr. Pritchard-Mitford from London. He flew over!" A door opened down a long cool corridor and Dr. Renshaw came out. He looked distraught and haggard. "Hello, Mitty," he said. "We're having the devil's own time with McMillan, the millionaire banker and close personal friend of Roosevelt. Obstreosis of the ductal tract. Tertiary. Wish you'd take a look at him."

A huge, complicated machine, connected to the operating table, with many tubes and wires, began at this moment to go pocketa-pocketa-pocketa. "The new anesthetizer is giving way!" shouted an intern. "There is no one in the East who knows how to fix it!" "Quiet, man!" said Mitty, in a low, cool voice. He sprang to the machine, which was now going pocketa-pocketa-queep-pocketa-queep. He began fingering delicately a row of glistening dials. "Give me a fountain pen!" he snapped. Someone handed him a fountain pen. He pulled a faulty piston out of the machine and inserted the pen in its place. "That will hold for ten minutes," he said. "Get on with the operation." A nurse hurried over and whispered to Renshaw, and Mitty saw the man turn pale. "Coreopsis has set in," said Renshaw nervously. "If you would take over, Mitty?" Mitty looked at him and at the craven figure of Benbow, who drank, and at the grave, uncertain faces of the two great specialists. "If you wish," he said. They slipped a white gown on him; he adjusted a mask and drew on thin gloves; nurses handed him shining ...</span>

Once he had tried to take his chains off, outside New Milford, and he had got them wound around the axles. A man had had to come out in a wrecking car and unwind them, a young, grinning garageman. Since then Mrs. Mitty always made him drive to a garage to have the chains taken off. The next time, he thought, I'll wear my right arm in a sling; they won't grin at me then. I'll have my right arm in a sling and they'll see I couldn't possibly take the chains off myself. He kicked at the slush on the sidewalk. "Overshoes," he said to himself, and he began looking for a shoe store.</p>

She had told him twice before they set out from their house for Waterbury. In a way he hated these weekly trips to town--he was always getting something wrong. Kleenex, he thought, Squibb's, razor blades? No. Toothpaste, toothbrush, bicarbonate, carborundum, initiative and referendum?</span>

The District Attorney suddenly thrust a heavy automatic at the quiet figure on the witness stand. "Have you ever seen this before?" Walter Mitty took the gun and examined it expertly. "This is my Webley-Vickers 50.80," he said calmly. An excited buzz ran around the courtroom. The Judge rapped for order.

"That man said, 'Puppy biscuit' to himself." Walter Mitty hurried on. He went into an A &amp; P, not the first one he came to but a smaller one farther up the street. "I want some biscuit for small, young dogs," he said to the clerk. "Any special brand, sir?" The greatest pistol shot in the world thought a moment.

There was a rending of wood and splinters flew through the room. "A bit of a near thing," said Captain Mitty carelessly. "The box barrage is closing in," said the sergeant. "We only live once, Sergeant," said Mitty, with his faint, fleeting smile. "Or do we?" He poured another brandy and tossed it off. "I never see a man could hold his brandy like you, sir," said the sergeant. "Begging your pardon, sir." Captain Mitty stood up and strapped on his huge Webley-Vickers automatic. "It's forty kilometers through hell, sir," said the sergeant. Mitty finished one last brandy. "After all," he said softly, "what isn't?"

          <p id="p_000804" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00003.smil#p_000804">"So," my mother said to us now, in the car, "I told your grandparents we'd be staying here."</p>
          <p id="p_000805" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00003.smil#p_000805">"Good," Eddie said, from the back seat. Of the three of us--Eddie and Lee and me--he was the one who had made the most friends.</p>
          <p id="p_000806" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00003.smil#p_000806">"I'm not sure I want to stay," I told my mother. "Or if Lee does." Lee was asleep, next to Eddie, with his head and shoulders on the seat and the rest of him limp on the floor.</p>
          <p id="p_000807" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00003.smil#p_000807">"Lee wants to stay, Jean," my mother said. "I already know that." She pulled up in front of our house. It was ten o'clock, and we had forgotten to leave on any lights.</p>
          <p id="p_000808" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00003.smil#p_000808">"Wake up, Lee," my mother said. She got out of the car and opened the back door and gently shook him. Sometimes he slept so soundly that it was impossible to wake him up. He opened his eyes for a moment and looked at the dark house.</p>
          <p id="p_000809" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00003.smil#p_000809">"Why isn't Dad home yet?" he asked. My mother picked him up and carried him inside. He and Eddie were small for their ages, whereas I was tall and too heavy. I watched my mother put Lee into bed. Eddie lay down on his own bed, against the opposite wall, and fell asleep with his clothes on.</p>

            <span class="text" id="span_000582" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00003.smil#span_000582">My mother and I went into the kitchen. Spread out over the table were letters from the</span>

We were supposed to receive twenty-five thousand dollars, and my mother was planning to use this money to buy the house we were in, which would allow us to live on the salary she made. The problem was that there had been people around, when the accident happened, who said that the fall had been my father's own fault, and not the fault of the construction company. So there was a chance the insurance company might not pay us. My mother was worried about this, and now she sat down at the table and began to fill out the forms.</span>
          </p>
          <p id="p_000811" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00003.smil#p_000811">I went into my room, next to the kitchen, which was really meant to be a small utility room. My father had painted it yellow and put in carpeting for me. I changed into my nightgown and got into bed. Every night since my father died, I had been unable to fall asleep. During the day I didn't cry, and it didn't upset me to hear about things my father had said or done. But as soon as I was almost asleep, memories would come into my mind that made our situation seem real to me. I stayed awake all night, it seemed to me, listening to my mother in the kitchen and to the distant noise of the cars on the highway.</p>
          <p id="p_000812" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00003.smil#p_000812">In the morning, my mother made me get up and get ready for school. My brothers and I had stayed home for a week after my father died, and then my mother allowed me to stay home for an additional week. I told her I didn't want to talk to people at school yet, but the truth was also that I had got used to staying home--to being able to wear my nightgown all day if I wanted to, or lie in bed all morning, reading a book. I didn't want to go back to living my life, because my life had started to seem like too much trouble. Each small thing, like brushing my teeth or putting on knee-socks, now made me tired. I felt I had to do fewer things each morning, in order to save energy for some more important thing I might have to do in the afternoon.</p>
          <p id="p_000813" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00003.smil#p_000813">After I ate breakfast, I walked to the end of our block and waited for the bus with Nancy Dyer, who was in my class. It was November, and she was wearing a blue corduroy jumper her mother had made. She had brought over my assignments, for the two weeks I had been home, and on the bus we went over them. I made corrections according to the answers she remembered from class. "You did real well," she said when we were finished. "But then, you're smarter than I am to begin with."</p>
          <p id="p_000814" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00003.smil#p_000814">"That's not true," I told her. "I just do more homework."</p>
          <p id="p_000815" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00003.smil#p_000815">"That's what I mean," she said. She had her eyes on her boyfriend, who was getting on the bus. He was a thin boy, with black hair. He sat in front of us. He ignored her and took out a piece of notebook paper and shot spitballs at a red-haired boy across the aisle.</p>
          <p id="p_000816" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00003.smil#p_000816">"He's mad at me all the time now," Nancy whispered. "I don't know why."</p>
          <p id="p_000817" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00003.smil#p_000817">She had tears in her eyes, and I looked away and watched the trees flashing past in the window. In the reflection, I could see that three people on the bus were looking at me--the red-haired boy, and two girls in the seat in front of him. When I first got on the bus, one of these girls had said, "There was an announcement in school about your dad."</p>
          <p id="p_000818" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00003.smil#p_000818">"I know," I said. "Nancy told me."</p>
          <p id="p_000819" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00003.smil#p_000819">"I can't believe that happened to you," she said, and whispered something that I couldn't hear to the other girl. Now, as I turned away from the window and looked across the aisle, the red-haired boy smiled at me and was about to say something when he was hit in the forehead by a spitball.</p>

In each class, the teacher took me aside and talked to me about my father, and two or three other people spoke to me about him as well. The boys, especially, wanted to know exactly what had happened.

"You can sit here, in the middle," Roberta Price said. Everyone moved over, and Carla Norris unwrapped my straw and put it in my milk. "We wondered when you were coming back," Roberta said. "The principal thought maybe last week."</p>
          <p id="p_000824" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00003.smil#p_000824">"I decided to wait until today," I told her. We began to eat. Most of us had bought hot lunches. We all had mothers who were either too busy in the mornings to make us sandwiches or who felt we were old enough now to make them ourselves. Carla was the one exception. Her mother not only made her a sandwich but put a note in with her lunch every day.</p>
          <p id="p_000825" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00003.smil#p_000825">"Here it is," Carla said. She unfolded a small piece of yellow paper. "Good luck on your geography quiz," she read out loud. "Your father and I are very proud of you." She and everybody else at the table looked down at their food.</p>
          <p id="p_000826" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00003.smil#p_000826">"That's better than the one where she told you to wash off your mascara," I said, after a silence.</p>
          <p id="p_000827" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00003.smil#p_000827">"It sure is," Roberta said quickly. "That one was sickening."</p>

My English teacher, Mr. Thompson, was sitting at his desk when I walked in. I went to my seat and listened to a boy standing next to Mr. Thompson's desk talk to him about commas.

          <p id="p_000843" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00003.smil#p_000843">We got off at our block and stood for a moment at the corner before we each went home. The air was so still that the traffic from the highway seemed louder than usual. "I guess I don't need to talk to you about feeling sad," Nancy said. "I forgot for a minute."</p>
          <p id="p_000844" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00003.smil#p_000844">"It's different with me," I told her. "It's not something you feel every second."</p>
          <p id="p_000845" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00003.smil#p_000845">I walked across the neighbors' yard and into our own; I put Lee's bike in the shed and went into the house through the kitchen door. My mother was standing in Lee's doorway, and I heard Lee say, "I got an A in spelling. Dad gave me fifty cents last time."</p>
          <p id="p_000846" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00003.smil#p_000846">My mother gave Lee two quarters, and then she walked past me into the kitchen, opened the kitchen door, and sat outside on our steps. I went out and sat beside her. "Did Dad really give Lee fifty cents?" she asked me.</p>
          <p id="p_000847" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00003.smil#p_000847">"I thought it was a quarter," I told her, "but I might be remembering it wrong." She held my hand, and we watched a squirrel race around the shed.</p>
          <p id="p_000848" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00003.smil#p_000848">"Would you give me a hug, honey?" she asked. I put my arms around her. In the past year, I had grown a lot, and now I was bigger than she was; when I hugged her, I was able to put my arms all the way around her.</p>
          <p id="p_000849" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00003.smil#p_000849">"I wish I'd stop growing," I told her.</p>
          <p id="p_000850" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00003.smil#p_000850">"You'll be tall, like Dad was," she said. "Someday you'll appreciate it." She stood up and walked down into the yard. She was still dressed in her work clothes--a skirt and blouse and high heels--and her shoes were invisible in the long grass. No one had mowed the yard since my father had died. "The lawn will have to be Eddie's job now," my mother said. "You and Lee can do the raking." She looked up toward the clatter of a woodpecker in our sweet-gum tree. "I'll find a gas station that will change the oil in the car, and then I'll teach myself to do the other things Dad did."</p>
          <p id="p_000851" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00003.smil#p_000851">"That seems like a lot," I told her.</p>
          <p id="p_000852" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00003.smil#p_000852">"I know it does, honey." She sat back down beside me and pulled up weeds that were growing out of the cracks in the steps. I looked around at the yard and the house--at the patches of bare ground under the trees, the peeling paint around the windows, and all the small holes in the screens--and thought that it would take an army of men to fix everything that was broken.</p>

          <p id="p_000854" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00003.smil#p_000854">"I made a touchdown today," Eddie said.</p>
          <p id="p_000855" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00003.smil#p_000855">"Well, good for you," my mother said. "I wish I could have seen it." She had eaten quickly, and she put her plate in the sink and drank a cup of instant coffee while she watched us finish.</p>
          <p id="p_000856" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00003.smil#p_000856">Afterward, I cleared the table and washed the dishes. I forgot that it was Eddie's turn, and he didn't remind me until I was done. He and Lee were sitting on the floor in the living room, with Lee's toy soldiers all around them. They were watching television with my mother. I came into the room and said, "I don't feel like watching TV."</p>
          <p id="p_000857" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00003.smil#p_000857">"Who cares?" Eddie asked.</p>
          <p id="p_000858" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00003.smil#p_000858">"We all care," my mother said sharply. "We're a family, even without Dad. We care what happens to each other." The way she spoke and the look on her face reminded me of my father, of the times he'd lost his temper with us. Eddie and Lee looked surprised, and then, a second later, there were tears on their faces.</p>
          <p id="p_000859" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00003.smil#p_000859">I was crying, too, because my mother had started to cry. But I wasn't upset about what Eddie had said or because my mother had got angry. I startled myself by feeling almost glad. It seemed to me that all of a sudden our lives were ordinary again, except that my father wasn't there, and I felt like I was paying attention after being lost in a daydream, or like I was opening my eyes after seeing how long I could keep them closed. When my mother started to speak, I hoped she wouldn't say something nice that would cancel out her angry words. But what she said was, "Okay. Pick up these toys. Then we're going to turn off the television and go to bed."</p>
          <p id="p_000860" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00003.smil#p_000860">It was only seven-thirty, but we went into our rooms. I didn't bother to put on my nightgown. I took off my clothes and got into bed in my underwear, and, even though it was early, I didn't have my same trouble falling asleep. I knew now that my father was dead and that we would live our lives without him, and I fell asleep right away, so that for a while I could not know these things.</p>

            <p id="p_000883" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#p_000883">I have always liked stories that sound like autobiography, but I write better about made-up characters than I do about myself and my own childhood. I wrote "Secrets," therefore, as a kind of invented autobiography--I imitated the form and style but made up the characters and their situation. What's important in writing is not that you tell the factual truth but that you tell the emotional truth. You have to be sure that your characters respond and feel just as they would if they were real people, and it's impossible to do that unless there is a part of you in your characters. There is a lot of me in Jean, and since she is my invention, there is now a lot of Jean in me. But we are not the same people, and we didn't have the same experiences. In terms of the setting of the story, I, myself, am from Indiana, though not from South Bend, and I've only driven through Jacksonville, Florida. I write best about places I hardly know; that way, I'm still curious about them. They seem mysterious and interesting to me, and I like to imagine who lives there and what their lives are like. That's how Jean and her family came into being.</p>

          <p id="p_000888" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#p_000888">The next week I bit back my tongue as we entered the store with the forbidden candies.

          <p id="p_000894" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#p_000894">At the end of our two-block alley was a small sandlot playground with swings and slides well-shined down the middle with use. The play area was bordered by wood-slat benches where old-country people sat cracking roasted watermelon seeds with their golden teeth and scattering the husks to an impatient gathering of gurgling pigeons. The best playground, however, was the dark alley itself. It was crammed with daily mysteries and adventures. My brothers and I would peer into the medicinal herb shop, watching old Li dole out onto a stiff sheet of white paper the right amount of insect shells, saffron-colored seeds, and pungent leaves for his ailing customers. It was said that he once cured a woman dying of an ancestral curse that had eluded the best of American doctors. Next to the pharmacy was a printer who specialized in gold-embossed wedding invitations and festive red banners.</p>
          <p id="p_000895" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#p_000895">Farther down the street was Ping Yuen Fish Market. The front window displayed a tank crowded with doomed fish and turtles struggling to gain footing on the slimy green-tiled sides. A hand-written sign informed tourists, "Within this store, is all for food, not for pet." Inside, the butchers with their bloodstained white smocks deftly gutted the fish while customers cried out their orders and shouted, "Give me your freshest," to which the butchers always protested, "All are freshest." On less crowded market days, we would inspect the crates of live frogs and crabs which we were warned not to poke, boxes of dried cuttlefish, and row upon row of iced prawns, squid, and slippery fish. The sanddabs made me shiver each time; their eyes lay on one flattened side and reminded me of my mother's story of a careless girl who ran into a crowded street and was crushed by a cab. "Was smash flat," reported my mother.</p>
          <p id="p_000896" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#p_000896">At the corner of the alley was Hong Sing's, a four-table cafÃ© with a recessed stairwell in front that led to a door marked "Tradesmen." My brothers and I believed the bad people emerged from this door at night. Tourists never went to Hong Sing's, since the menu was printed only in Chinese. A Caucasian man with a big camera once posed me and my playmates in front of the restaurant. He had us move to the side of the picture window so the photo would capture the roasted duck with its head dangling from a juice-covered rope. After he took the picture, I told him he should go into Hong Sing's and eat dinner. When he smiled and asked me what they served, I shouted, "Guts and duck's feet and octopus gizzards!" Then I ran off with my friends, shrieking with laughter as we scampered across the alley and hid in the entryway grotto of the China Gem Company, my heart pounding with hope that he would chase us.</p>
          <p id="p_000897" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#p_000897">My mother named me after the street that we lived on: Waverly Place Jong, my official name for important American documents. But my family called me Meimei, "Little Sister." I was the youngest, the only daughter. Each morning before school, my mother would twist and yank on my thick black hair until she had formed two tightly wound pigtails. One day, as she struggled to weave a hard-toothed comb through my disobedient hair, I had a sly thought.</p>
          <p id="p_000898" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#p_000898">I asked her, "Ma, what is Chinese torture?" My mother shook her head. A bobby pin was wedged between her lips. She wetted her palm and smoothed the hair above my ear, then pushed the pin in so that it nicked sharply against my scalp.</p>

            <span class="text" id="span_000610" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#span_000610">"Who say this word?" she asked without a</span>

          <p id="p_000901" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#p_000901">My older brother Vincent was the one who actually got the chess set. We had gone to the annual Christmas party held at the First Chinese Baptist Church at the end of the alley. The missionary ladies had put together a Santa bag of gifts donated by members of another church. None of the gifts had names on them. There were separate sacks for boys and girls of different ages.</p>
          <p id="p_000902" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#p_000902">One of the Chinese parishioners had donned a Santa Claus costume and a stiff paper beard with cotton balls glued to it. I think the only children who thought he was the real thing were too young to know that Santa Claus was not Chinese. When my turn came up, the Santa man asked me how old I was. I thought it was a trick question; I was seven according to the American formula and eight by the Chinese calendar. I said I was born on March 17, 1951. That seemed to satisfy him. He then solemnly asked if I had been a very, very good girl this year and did I believe in Jesus Christ and obey my parents. I knew the only answer to that. I nodded back with equal solemnity.</p>
          <p id="p_000903" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#p_000903">Having watched the other children opening their gifts, I already knew that the big gifts were not necessarily the nicest ones. One girl my age got a large coloring book of biblical characters, while a less greedy girl who selected a smaller box received a glass vial of lavender toilet water. The sound of the box was also important. A ten-year-old boy had chosen a box that jangled when he shook it. It was a tin globe of the world with a slit for inserting money. He must have thought it was full of dimes and nickels, because when he saw that it had just ten pennies, his face fell with such undisguised disappointment that his mother slapped the side of his head and led him out of the church hall, apologizing to the crowd for her son who had such bad manners he couldn't appreciate such a fine gift.</p>
          <p id="p_000904" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#p_000904">As I peered into the sack, I quickly fingered the remaining presents, testing their weight, imagining what they contained. I chose a heavy, compact one that was wrapped in shiny silver foil and a red satin ribbon. It was a twelve-pack of Life Savers and I spent the rest of the party arranging and rearranging the candy tubes in the order of my favorites. My brother Winston chose wisely as well. His present turned out to be a box of intricate plastic parts; the instructions on the box proclaimed that when they were properly assembled he would have an authentic miniature replica of a World War II submarine.</p>
          <p id="p_000905" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#p_000905">Vincent got the chess set, which would have been a very decent present to get at a church Christmas party, except it was obviously used and, as we discovered later, it was missing a black pawn and a white knight. My mother graciously thanked the unknown benefactor, saying, "Too good. Cost too much." At which point, an old lady with fine white, wispy hair nodded toward our family and said with a whistling whisper, "Merry, merry Christmas."</p>
          <p id="p_000906" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#p_000906">When we got home, my mother told Vincent to throw the chess set away. "She not want it. We not want it," she said, tossing her head stiffly to the side with a tight, proud smile. My brothers had deaf ears. They were already lining up the chess pieces and reading from the dog-eared instruction book.</p>

            <span class="text" id="span_000613" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#span_000613">Christmas week. The chess board seemed to hold elaborate secrets waiting to be untangled. The chessmen were more powerful than Old Li's magic herbs that cured ancestral curses. And my brothers wore such serious faces that I was sure something was at stake that was greater than avoiding the tradesmen's door to Hong Sing's.</span>

          <p id="p_000908" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#p_000908">"Let me! Let me!" I begged between games when one brother or the other would sit back with a deep sigh of relief and victory, the other annoyed, unable to let go of the outcome. Vincent at first refused to let me play, but when I offered my Life Savers as replacements for the buttons that filled in for the missing pieces, he relented. He chose the flavors: wild cherry for the black pawn and peppermint for the white knight. Winner could eat both.</p>
          <p id="p_000909" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#p_000909">As our mother sprinkled flour and rolled out small doughy circles for the steamed dumplings that would be our dinner that night, Vincent explained the rules, pointing to each piece. "You have sixteen pieces and so do I. One king and queen, two bishops, two knights, two castles, and eight pawns. The pawns can only move forward one step, except on the first move. Then they can move two. But they can only take men by moving crossways like this, except in the beginning, when you can move ahead and take another pawn."</p>
          <p id="p_000910" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#p_000910">"Why?" I asked as I moved my pawn. "Why can't they move more steps?"</p>
          <p id="p_000911" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#p_000911">"Because they're pawns," he said.</p>
          <p id="p_000912" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#p_000912">"But why do they go crossways to take other men. Why aren't there any women and children?"</p>
          <p id="p_000913" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#p_000913">"Why is the sky blue? Why must you always ask stupid questions?" asked Vincent. "This is a game. These are the rules. I didn't make them up. See. Here. In the book." He jabbed a page with a pawn in his hand. "Pawn. P-A-W-N. Pawn. Read it yourself."</p>
          <p id="p_000914" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#p_000914">My mother patted the flour off her hands. "Let me see book," she said quietly. She scanned the pages quickly, not reading the foreign English symbols, seeming to search deliberately for nothing in particular.</p>
          <p id="p_000915" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#p_000915">"This American rules," she concluded at last. "Every time people come out from foreign country, must know rules. You not know, judge say, Too bad, go back. They not telling you why so you can use their way go forward. They say, Don't know why, you find out yourself. But they knowing all the time. Better you take it, find out why yourself." She tossed her head back with a satisfied smile.</p>
          <p id="p_000916" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#p_000916">I found out about all the whys later. I read the rules and looked up all the big words in a dictionary.

I learned why it is essential in the endgame to have foresight, a mathematical understanding of all possible moves, and patience; all weaknesses and advantages become evident to a strong adversary and are obscured to a tiring opponent. I discovered that for the whole game one must gather invisible strengths and see the endgame before the game begins.</span>

I ran home and grabbed Vincent's chess set, which was bound in a cardboard box with rubber bands. I also carefully selected two prized rolls of Life Savers.

I was playing in a large high school auditorium that echoed with phlegmy coughs and the squeaky rubber knobs of chair legs sliding across freshly waxed wooden floors. Seated across from me was an American man, about the same age as Lau Po, maybe fifty. I remember that his sweaty brow seemed to weep at my every move. He wore a dark, malodorous suit. One of his pockets was stuffed with a great white kerchief on which he wiped his palm before sweeping his hand over the chosen chess piece with great flourish.</p>

          <p id="p_000952" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#p_000952">I no longer played in the alley of Waverly Place. I never visited the playground where the pigeons and old men gathered. I went to school, then directly home to learn new chess secrets, cleverly concealed advantages, more escape routes.</p>
          <p id="p_000953" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#p_000953">But I found it difficult to concentrate at home. My mother had a habit of standing over me while I plotted out my games. I think she thought of herself as my protective ally. Her lips would be sealed tight, and after each move I made, a soft "Hmmmmph" would escape from her nose.</p>
          <p id="p_000954" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#p_000954">"Ma, I can't practice when you stand there like that," I said one day. She retreated to the kitchen and made loud noises with the pots and pans. When the crashing stopped, I could see out of the corner of my eye that she was standing in the doorway. "Hmmmmph!" Only this one came out of her tight throat.</p>
          <p id="p_000955" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#p_000955">My parents made many concessions to allow me to practice. One time I complained that the bedroom I shared was so noisy that I couldn't think. Thereafter, my brothers slept in a bed in the living room facing the street. I said I couldn't finish my rice; my head didn't work right when my stomach was too full. I left the table with half-finished bowls and nobody complained. But there was one duty I couldn't avoid. I had to accompany my mother on Saturday market days when I had no tournament to play. My mother would proudly walk with me, visiting many shops, buying very little. "This my daughter Wavely Jong," she said to whoever looked her way.</p>
          <p id="p_000956" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#p_000956">One day, after we left a shop I said under my breath, "I wish you wouldn't do that, telling everybody I'm your daughter." My mother stopped walking. Crowds of people with heavy bags pushed past us on the sidewalk, bumping into first one shoulder, then another.</p>
          <p id="p_000957" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#p_000957">"Aiii-ya. So shame be with mother?" She grasped my hand even tighter as she glared at me.</p>
          <p id="p_000958" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#p_000958">I looked down. "It's not that, it's just so obvious. It's just so embarrassing."</p>
          <p id="p_000959" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#p_000959">"Embarrass you be my daughter?" Her voice was cracking with anger.</p>
          <p id="p_000960" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#p_000960">"That's not what I meant. That's not what I said."</p>
          <p id="p_000961" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#p_000961">"What you say?"</p>
          <p id="p_000962" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#p_000962">I knew it was a mistake to say anything more, but I heard my voice speaking. "Why do you have to use me to show off? If you want to show off, then why don't you learn to play chess."</p>
          <p id="p_000963" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#p_000963">My mother's eyes turned into dangerous black slits. She had no words for me, just sharp silence.</p>
          <p id="p_000964" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#p_000964">I felt the wind rushing around my hot ears. I jerked my hand out of my mother's tight grasp and spun around, knocking into an old woman. Her bag of groceries spilled to the ground.</p>
          <p id="p_000965" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#p_000965">"Aii-ya! Stupid girl!" my mother and the woman cried. Oranges and tin cans careened down the sidewalk. As my mother stooped to help the old woman pick up the escaping food, I took off.</p>
          <p id="p_000966" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#p_000966">I raced down the street, dashing between people, not looking back as my mother screamed shrilly, "Meimei! Meimei!" I fled down an alley, past dark curtained shops and merchants washing the grime off their windows. I sped into the sunlight, into a large street crowded with tourists examining trinkets and souvenirs. I ducked into another dark alley, down another street, up another alley. I ran until it hurt and I realized I had nowhere to go, that I was not running from anything. The alleys contained no escape routes.</p>
          <p id="p_000967">
            <span class="text" id="span_000651" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#span_000651">My breath came out like angry smoke. It</span>

I sat down on an upturned plastic pail next to a stack of empty boxes, cupping my chin with my hands, thinking hard. I imagined my mother, first walking briskly down one street or another looking for me, then giving up and returning home to await my arrival. After two hours, I stood up on creaking legs and slowly walked home.</span>

          <p id="p_000968" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#p_000968">The alley was quiet and I could see the yellow lights shining from our flat like two tiger's eyes in the night. I climbed the sixteen steps to the door, advancing quietly up each so as not to make any warning sounds. I heard a chair moving, quick steps, the locks turning--click! click! click!--and the door opened.</p>
          <p id="p_000969" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#p_000969">"About time you got home," said Vincent.</p>

On a platter were the remains of a large fish, its fleshy head still connected to bones swimming upstream in vain escape.

          <p id="p_000974" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#p_000974">I walked into my room, closed the door, and lay down on my bed. The room was dark, the ceiling filled with shadows from the dinnertime lights of neighboring flats.</p>

As you learn more about Waverly, you become an active participant in the story. Just as Waverly's awareness of the changing relationship with her mother increases, so does your understanding of Waverly's character grow. You come to know and appreciate a complex, many-sided character who has demonstrated the capacity to change. Write an essay tracing Waverly's development. Refer to both direct and indirect methods of characterization used in the story.</p>

          <p id="p_001010" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#p_001010">The orphanage is high in the Carolina mountains. Sometimes in winter the snowdrifts are so deep that the institution is cut off from the village below, from all the world. Fog hides the mountain peaks, the snow swirls down the valleys, and a wind blows so bitterly that the orphanage boys who take the milk twice daily to the baby cottage reach the door with fingers stiff in an agony of numbness.</p>
          <p id="p_001011" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#p_001011">"Or when we carry trays from the cookhouse for the ones that are sick," Jerry said, "we get our faces frostbit, because we can't put our hands over them. I have gloves," he added. "Some of the boys don't have any."</p>
          <p id="p_001012" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#p_001012">He liked the late spring, he said. The rhododendron was in bloom, a carpet of color, across the mountainsides, soft as the May winds that stirred the hemlocks. He called it laurel.</p>
          <p id="p_001013" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#p_001013">"It's pretty when the laurel blooms," he said. "Some of it's pink and some of it's white."</p>
          <p id="p_001014" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#p_001014">I was there in the autumn. I wanted quiet, isolation, to do some troublesome writing. I wanted mountain air to blow out the malaria from too long a time in the sub tropics. I was homesick, too, for the flaming of maples in October, and for corn shocks and pumpkins and black-walnut trees and the lift of hills. I found them all, living in a cabin that belonged to the orphanage, half a mile beyond the orphanage farm. When I took the cabin, I asked for a boy or man to come and chop wood for the fireplace. The first few days were warm, I found what wood I needed about the cabin, no one came, and I forgot the order.</p>
          <p id="p_001015" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#p_001015">I looked up from my typewriter one late afternoon, a little startled. A boy stood at the door, and my pointer dog, my companion, was at his side and had not barked to warn me. The boy was probably twelve years old, but undersized. He wore overalls and a torn shirt, and was barefooted.</p>
          <p id="p_001016" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#p_001016">He said, "I can chop some wood today."</p>
          <p id="p_001017" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#p_001017">I said, "But I have a boy coming from the orphanage."</p>
          <p id="p_001018" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#p_001018">"I'm the boy."</p>

          <p id="p_001020" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#p_001020">"Size don't matter, chopping wood," he said. "Some of the big boys don't chop good. I've been chopping wood at the orphanage a long time."</p>

          <p id="p_001021" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#p_001021">I visualized mangled and inadequate branches for my fires. I was well into my work and not inclined to conversation. I was a little blunt.</p>
          <p id="p_001022" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#p_001022">"Very well. There's the ax. Go ahead and see what you can do."</p>
          <p id="p_001023" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#p_001023">I went back to work, closing the door. At first the sound of the dragging brush annoyed me. Then he began to chop. The blows were rhythmic and steady, and shortly l had forgotten him, the sound no more of an interruption than a consistent rain. I suppose an hour and a half passed, for when I stopped and stretched, and heard the boy's steps on the cabin stoop, the sun was dropping behind the farthest mountain, and the valleys were purple with something deeper than the asters.</p>
          <p id="p_001024" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#p_001024">The boy said, "I have to go to supper now. I can come again tomorrow evening."</p>
          <p id="p_001025" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#p_001025">I said, "I'll pay you now for what you've done," thinking I should probably have to insist on an older boy. "Ten cents an hour?"</p>

          <p id="p_001027" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#p_001027">We went together back of the cabin. An astonishing amount of solid wood had been cut. There were cherry logs and heavy roots of rhododendron, and blocks from the waste pine and oak left from the building of the cabin.</p>
          <p id="p_001028" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#p_001028">"But you've done as much as a man," I said. "This is a splendid pile."</p>
          <p id="p_001029" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#p_001029">I looked at him, actually, for the first time. His hair was the color of the corn shocks and his eyes, very direct, were like the mountain sky when rain is pending--gray, with a shadowing of that miraculous blue. As I spoke, a light came over him, as though the setting sun had touched him with the same suffused glory with which it touched the mountains. I gave him a quarter.</p>
          <p id="p_001030" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#p_001030">"You may come tomorrow," I said, "and thank you very much."</p>
          <p id="p_001031" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#p_001031">He looked at me, and at the coin, and seemed to want to speak, but could not, and turned away.</p>

          <p id="p_001034" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#p_001034">At daylight I was half wakened by the sound of chopping. Again it was so even in texture that I went back to sleep. When I left my bed in the cool morning, the boy had come and gone, and a stack of kindling was neat against the cabin wall. He came after school in the afternoon and worked until time to return to the orphanage. His name was Jerry; he was twelve years old, and he had been at the orphanage since he was four. I could picture him at four, with the same grave gray-blue eyes and the same--independence? No, the word that comes to me is "integrity".</p>

My father had it--there is another of whom I am almost sure--but almost no man of my acquaintance possesses it with the clarity, the purity, the simplicity of a mountain stream. But the boy Jerry had it. It is bedded on courage, but it is more than brave. It is honest, but it is more than honesty. The ax handle broke one day. Jerry said the woodshop at the orphanage would repair it. I brought money to pay for the job and he refused it.</span>

There, of his own accord, he put kindling and "medium" wood, so that I might always have dry fire material ready in case of sudden wet weather. A stone was loose in the rough walk to the cabin. He dug a deeper hole and steadied it, although he came, himself, by a short cut over the bank. I found that when I tried to return his thoughtfulness with such things as candy and apples, he was wordless. "Thank you" was, perhaps, an expression for which he had had no use, for his courtesy was instinctive. He only looked at the gift and at me, and a curtain lifted, so that I saw deep into the clear well of his eyes, and gratitude was there, and affection, soft over the firm granite of his character.</span>

I could no more have turned him away than if he had been physically hungry. I suggested once that the best time for us to visit was just before supper, when I left off my writing. After that, he waited always until my typewriter had been some time quiet. One day I worked until nearly dark. I went outside the cabin, having forgotten him. I saw him going up over the hill in the twilight toward the orphanage. When I sat down on my stoop, a place was warm from his body where he had been sitting.</p>
          <p id="p_001043" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#p_001043">He became intimate, of course, with my pointer, Pat. There is a strange communion between a boy and a dog. Perhaps they possess the same singleness of spirit, the same kind of wisdom. It is difficult to explain, but it exists. When I went across the state for a weekend, I left the dog in Jerry's charge. I gave him the dog whistle and the key to the cabin, and left sufficient food. He was to come two or three times a day and let out the dog, feed and exercise him. I should return Sunday night, and Jerry would take out the dog for the last time Sunday afternoon and then leave the key under an agreed hiding place.</p>
          <p id="p_001044" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#p_001044">My return was belated and fog filled the mountain passes so treacherously that I dared not drive at night. The fog held the next morning, and it was Monday noon before I reached the cabin. The dog had been fed and cared for that morning. Jerry came early in the afternoon, anxious.</p>
          <p id="p_001045" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#p_001045">"The superintendent said nobody would drive in the fog," he said.

The dog lay close to him, and found a comfort there that I did not have for him. And it seemed to me that being with my dog, and caring for him, had brought the boy and me, too, together, so that he felt that he belonged to me as well as to the animal.</p>

I took him up over the hill and we both ran fast. There was a place where the grass was high and I lay down in it and hid. I could hear Pat hunting for me. He found my trail and he barked.

          <p id="p_001208" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#p_001208">"Be it so," I said, replacing the tool beneath the cloak, and again offering him my arm. He leaned upon it heavily. We continued our route in search of the Amontillado. We passed through a range of low arches, descended, passed on, and, descending again, arrived at a deep crypt, in which the foulness of the air caused our flambeaux rather to glow than flame.</p>
          <p id="p_001209" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#p_001209">At the most remote end of the crypt there appeared another less spacious. Its walls had been lined with human remains, piled to the vault overhead, in the fashion of the great catacombs of Paris. Three sides of this interior crypt were still ornamented in this manner. From the fourth the bones had been thrown down, and lay promiscuously upon the earth, forming at one point a mound of some size. Within the wall thus exposed by the displacing of the bones, we perceived a still interior recess, in depth about four feet, in width three, in height six or seven. It seemed to have been constructed for no especial use within itself, but formed merely the interval between two of the colossal supports of the roof of the catacombs, and was backed by one of their circumscribing walls of solid granite.</p>
          <p id="p_001210" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00004.smil#p_001210">It was in vain that Fortunato, uplifting his dull torch, endeavored to pry into the depth of the recess. Its termination the feeble light did not enable us to see.</p>

In an instant he had reached the extremity of the niche, and finding his progress arrested by the rock, stood stupidly bewildered. A moment more and I had fettered him to the granite. In its surface were two iron staples, distant from each other about two feet, horizontally. From one of these depended a short chain, from the other a padlock. Throwing the links about his waist, it was but the work of a few seconds to secure it. He was too much astounded to resist. Withdrawing the key I stepped back from the recess.</p>

I struggled with its weight; I placed it partially in its destined position. But now there came from out the niche a low laugh that erected the hairs upon my head. It was succeeded by a sad voice, which I had difficulty in recognizing as that of the noble Fortunato. The voice said--</p>

              <span class="text" id="span_000837" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#span_000837">The son of actors, Edgar Allan Poe was orphaned at the age of two. He was taken in by a childless couple, Mr. and Mrs. John Allan of Richmond, Virginia. The Allans gave Poe a gentleman's education but never formally adopted him. Poe entered the University of Virginia and soon ran up large debts, which the Allans refused to pay. Poe left the University before his first academic year ended. Under an assumed name, he enlisted in the army and rose to the rank of sergeant major. After two years he entered West Point, but chafing under the restraints of military discipline, he deliberately provoked a court-martial and was expelled from the Academy. Thereafter, the Allans would no longer help him.</span>

            <p id="p_001275" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001275">The rest of Poe's life was a struggle to support himself through writing and editing. His marriage to Virginia Clemm, his thirteen-year-old cousin, added to his financial burdens. She died of tuberculosis when she was twenty-five. Poe worked as an editor on several magazines, but the work was taxing and the pay small.</p>
            <p id="p_001276" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001276">Today Poe is equally famous for his short stories and his poetry. Among his best-known poems are "The Raven," "Ulalume," "Annabel Lee," and "The Bells." Among his most famous short stories are "The Black Cat," "The Fall of the House of Usher," "The Pit and the Pendulum," and "The Murders in the Rue Morgue." Poe believed that a short story should be planned and written so that every word, every detail contributes toward a single, powerful impression.</p>

The truth is I sometimes like to tell stories about bloodthirsty vampires or ugly monsters that lurk in clothes closets or giant beetles that eat their way through the shower curtain, like I used to do at camp to entertain the kids in my bunk. But Joanne always cries and that makes the stories even weirder, like background music her crying. And too--I'm not going to lie about it--I get spookier on purpose until all the little crybabies are stuffing themselves under their pillows and throwing their sneakers at me and making such a racket that Mary the counselor has to come in and shine her flashlight around the bunkhouse. I play like I'm asleep. The rest of them are too busy blubbering and finding their way out from under the blankets to tell Mary that it's me. Besides, once they get a load of her standing against the moonlight in that long white robe of hers looking like a ghost, they just start up again and pretty soon the whole camp is awake. Anyway, that's what I do for fun. So Joanne hasn't been around. And this year I'll have to go to the circus by myself and to camp without her. My mother said on the phone to Aunt Hazel-"Good, keep Jo over there and maybe Harriet'll behave herself if she's got no one to show off to." For all the years my mother's known me, she still doesn't understand that my behaving has got nothing to do with who I hang out with. A private thing between me and me or maybe between me and the Fly family since they were the ones that first got me to sit through monster movies and withstand all the terror I could take.</p>

Each year they get bolder and more daring with their rope dancing and the swinging by the legs and flinging themselves into empty space making everyone throw up their hands and gasp for air until Mr. Fly at the very last possible second swings out on his bar to catch them up by the tips of their heels. Everyone just dies and clutches at their hearts. Everybody but me. I sit there calmly. I've trained myself. Joanne used to die and duck her head under the benches and stay there till it was all over.</span>

On the final performance just before the fair closed, and some revival-type tent show comes in and all the kids go off to camp, the Fly family performed without a net. I figured they'd be up to something so I made sure my stomach was like steel. I did ten push-ups before breakfast, twenty sit-ups before lunch, skipped dinner altogether. My brother Teddy kidded all day--"Harriet's trying out for the Olympics." I passed up the ice man on the corner and the pizza and sausage stand by the schoolyard and the cotton candy and jelly-apple lady and the pickle and penny-candy boy, in fact I passed up all the stands that lead from the street down the little roadway to the fair grounds that used to be a swamp when we first moved from Baltimore to Jamaica, Long Island.

And from the wheel of fortune to the tent was at least a million stands selling B.B. bats and jawbreakers and gingerbread and sweet potato pie and frozen custard and--like I said it wasn't easy. A million ways to tempt you, to unsettle your stomach, and make you lose the battle to the Fly family.</span>

          <p id="p_001283" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001283">I sat there almost enjoying the silly clowns who came tumbling out of a steamer trunk no bigger than the one we have in the basement where my mother keeps my old report cards and photographs and letters and things. And I almost enjoyed the fire-eater and the knife-thrower, but I was so close up I could see how there wasn't any real thrill. I almost enjoyed the fat-leg girls who rode the ponies two at a time and standing up, but their costumes weren't very pretty-just an ordinary polo shirt like you get if you run in the PAL meets and short skirts you can wear on either side like the big girls wear at the roller rink. And I almost enjoyed the jugglers except that my Uncle Bubba can juggle the dinner plates better any day of the week so long as Aunt Hazel isn't there to stop him. I was impatient and started yawning. Finally all the clowns hitched up their baggy pants and tumbled over each other out of the ring and into the dark, the jugglers caught all the things that were up in the air and yawning just like me went off to the side. The pony girls brought their horses to a sudden stop that raised a lot of dust, then jumped down into the dirt and bowed. Then the ringmaster stepped into the circle of light and tipped his hat which was a little raggedy from where I was sitting and said--"And now, Ladieeez and Gentlemen, what you've alll been waiting forrr, the Main aTTRACtion, the FLY FAMILEEE." And everyone jumped up to shout like crazy as they came running out on their toes to stand in the light and then climb the ropes. I took a deep breath and folded my arms over my chest and a kid next to me went into hiding, acting like she was going to tie her shoelaces.</p>
          <p id="p_001284" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001284">There used to be four of them--the father, a big guy with a bald head and bushy mustache and shoulders and arms like King Kong; a tall lanky mother whom you'd never guess could even climb into a high chair or catch anything heavier than a Ping-Pong ball to look at her; the oldest son who looked like his father except he had hair on his head but none on his face and a big face it was, so that no matter how high up he got you could always tell whether he was smiling or frowning or counting; the younger boy about thirteen, maybe, had a vacant stare like he was a million miles away feeding his turtles or something, anything but walking along a tightrope or flying through the air with his family. I had always liked to watch him because he was as cool as I was. But last summer the little girl got into the act. My grandmother says she's probably a midget cause no self-respecting mother would allow her child to be up there acting like a bird. "Just a baby," she'd say, "Can't be more than six years old. Should be home in bed. Must be a midget." My grandfather would give me a look when she started in and we'd smile at her together.</p>

And then they'd mess around two or three flying at once just to confuse you until the big drum roll started and out steps the little girl in a party dress and huge blindfold wrapped around her little head and a pink umbrella like they sell down in Chinatown. And I almost--I won't lie about it-- I almost let my heart thump me off the bench. I almost thought I too had to tie my shoelaces. But I sat there. Stubborn. And the kid starts bouncing up and down on the rope like she was about to take off and tear through the canvas roof. Then out swings her little brother and before you know it, Fly Jr. like a great eagle with his arms flapping grabs up the kid, her eyeband in his teeth and swoops her off to the bar that's already got Mrs. Mr. and Big Bro on it and surely there's no room for him. And everyone's standing on their feet clutching at their faces. Everyone but me. Cause I know from the getgo that Mr. and Mrs. are going to leave the bar to give Jr. room and fly over to the other side. Which is exactly what they do. The lady in front of me, Mrs. Perez, who does all the sewing in our neighborhood, gets up and starts shaking her hands like ladies do to get the fingernail polish dry and she says to me with her eyes jammed shut "I must go finish the wedding gowns. Tell me later who died." And she scoots through the aisle, falling all over everybody with her eyes still shut and never looks up. And Mrs. Caine taps me on the back and leans over and says, "Some people just can't take it." And I smile at her and at her twins who're sitting there with their mouths open. I fold my arms over my chest and just dare the Fly family to do their very worst.</span>

I had to tell Mary the latest doings with the Fly family. But she put a finger to her mouth like she sometimes does to shush me. "Let's not have any scary stuff this summer, Harriet," she said, looking over my shoulder at a new kid. This new kid, Willie, was from my old neighborhood in Baltimore so we got friendly right off. Then he told me that he had a romantic heart so I quite naturally took him under my wing and decided not to give him a heart attack with any ghost tales. Mary said he meant "rheumatic" heart,</span>

So I told Mary to move him out of George's tent and give him a nicer counselor who'd respect his romantic heart. George used to be my play boyfriend when I first came to camp as a little kid and didn't know any better. But he's not a nice person. He makes up funny nicknames for people which aren't funny at all. Like calling Eddie Michaels the Watermelon Kid or David Farmer Charcoal Plenty which I really do not appreciate and especially from a counselor. And once he asked Joanne, who was the table monitor, to go fetch a pail of milk from the kitchen. And the minute she got up, he started hatching a plot, trying to get the kids to hide her peanut butter sandwich and put spiders in her soup. I had to remind everyone at the table that Joanne was my first cousin by blood, and I would be forced to waste the first bum that laid a hand on her plate. And ole George says, "Oh don't be a dumbhead, Harriet. Jo's so stupid she won't even notice." And I told him right then and there that I was not his play girlfriend anymore and would rather marry the wolfman than grow up and be his wife. And just in case he didn't get the message, that night around campfire when we were all playing Little Sally Walker sittin' in a saucer and it was my turn to shake it to the east and to shake it to the west and to shake it to the very one that I loved the best--I shook straight for Mr. Nelson the lifeguard, who was not only the ugliest person in camp but the arch enemy of ole George.</span>

A long, smooth, streamlined head. A sure sign of superior gifts. Definitely genius proportions." And poor Willie went for it, grinning and carrying on and touching his head, which if you want to know the truth is a bullet head and that's all there is to it. And he's turning to me every which way, like he's modeling his head in a fashion show. And the minute his back is turned, ole George makes a face about Willie's head and all the kids in the line bust out laughing. So I had to beat up a few right then and there and finish off the rest later in the shower for being so stupid, laughing at a kid with a romantic heart.</p>

And Willie started this whimpering in the back of his throat so I had to switch the story real quick to something cheerful. But before I</span>

And every time he got to the part where the phantom ripped out a heart, poor Willie would get louder and louder until finally he started rolling around in the grass and screaming and all the kids went crazy and scattered behind the rocks almost kicking the fire completely out as they dashed off into the darkness yelling bloody murder. And the counselors could hardly round us all up--me, too, I'm not going to lie about it. Their little circles of flashlight bobbing in and out of the bushes along the patches of pine, bumping into each other as they scrambled for us kids. And poor Willie rolling around something awful, so they took him to the infirmary.</span>

I was hoping he'd open his eyes and wink at me and tell me he was just fooling. That it wasn't so bad to have an underprivileged heart. But he just slept. "I'm an underprivileged kid too," I thought to myself. I knew it was a special camp, but I'd never realized. No wonder Aunt Hazel screamed so about my scary stories and my mother flicked off the TV when the monsters came on and Mary was always shushing me. We all had bad hearts. I crawled into the supply cabinet to wait for Willie to wake up so I could ask him about it all. I ate all the ginger-snaps but I didn't feel any better. You have a romantic heart, I whispered to myself settling down among the bandages. You will have to be very careful.</p>

As far as she was concerned, I was still the same ole spooky kid I'd always been. So Joanne was kept at home. My mother noticed the difference, but she said over the phone to my grandmother, "She's acting very ladylike these days, growing up." I didn't tell her about my secret, that I knew about my heart. And I was kind of glad Joanne wasn't around 'cause I would have blabbed it all to her and scared her to death. When school starts again, I decided, I'll ask my teacher how to outgrow my underprivileged heart. I'll train myself, just like I did with the Fly family.</p>

She began writing when she was still a child. She took the name Bambara from a signature she found in a sketchbook in a trunk belonging to her great-grandmother. Bambara was known for the poetic quality of her prose and for her accurate rendering of African American street talk. The writer Anne Tyler said of Bambara's characters: "Everything these people say, you feel, ordinary, real-life people are saying right now on any street corner. It's only that the rest of us didn't realize it was sheer poetry they were speaking." Bambara's books include</span>

          <p id="p_001334" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001334">When Dr. Frazier came, Bennie's grandmother told him to run down to the spring and wade in the stream that flowed from it across the pasture field to Mr. Charley Miller's pond, or play under the big oak tree that stood between her field and Mr. Charley Miller's. He started along the path, but when he was about midway to the spring he stopped. He had waded in the stream and caught minnows all that morning. He had played under the oak tree all yesterday afternoon. He had asked his grandmother to let him walk the mile and a half down the road to James and Robert Lee Stewart's to play, but she had not let him go. There was nothing he wanted to do alone. He wanted someone to play with. He turned and went back and crept under the window of his grandmother's room. Their voices floated low and quiet out into the cool shade that lay over the house.</p>
          <p id="p_001335" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001335">"How long will it be?" he heard his grandmother say.</p>

          <p id="p_001338" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001338">"Yes. You should have sent for me long ago."</p>

          <p id="p_001341" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001341">"How will it come? Tell me, Doctor. I can stand it."</p>
          <p id="p_001342" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001342">"There will be sharp, quick pains like the ones you've been having. Your heart cannot stand many more attacks. It grows weaker with each one, even though you're able to go about your work as you did before the attack came.

          <p id="p_001351" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001351">"Please," Dr. Frazier said.</p>

          <p id="p_001353" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001353">In a moment, Bennie heard them walking out onto the porch through the door of her room. Then he could see them as they crossed the yard to the gate, where Dr. Frazier's horse and buggy stood. He was a little man, with a skin that was almost black. He climbed into his buggy and started up the road toward the town, which was three miles away, and she stood and looked after him. Her back was to the house. People said that Bennie's grandmother had Indian blood in her veins, for she had high cheekbones and her nose was long and straight, but her mouth was big. Her eyes seemed as though they were buried way back in her head, in a mass of wrinkles. They danced and twinkled whenever they looked at him. She was a big woman, and she wore long full skirts that came all the way to the ground.</p>
          <p id="p_001354" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001354">She closed the gate and started back to the house, and it came to Bennie that he was alone with her, and that she was going to die soon. He turned and ran noiselessly across the backyard, through the back gate, and down the path to the spring.</p>
          <p id="p_001355" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001355">When he reached the spring, he kept running. He ran across the pasture field and up the hill to the barbed-wire fence that divided his grandmother's land from Mr. Charley Miller's. He threw himself to the ground and rolled under the fence, picked himself up on the other side, and ran through Mr. Charley Miller's field of alfalfa and into the woods, until at last he fell exhausted in the cool damp grass of a shaded clearing.</p>
          <p id="p_001356" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001356">His grandmother was going to die. She might even be dead now. She was going to lie cold and still, in a long black casket that would be put into a hearse that would take her to church in town. The Reverend Isaiah Jones would preach her funeral. People would cry, because people liked his grandmother. His mother would cry. He would cry. And now he was crying, and he could not stop crying.</p>

He must get up and go back to the house. He would have to be alone with his grandmother until his mother came home from the Fieldses' after she had cooked their supper. And he must tell no one what he had heard Dr. Frazier say to his grandmother.</p>
          <p id="p_001358" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001358">He found her sitting in her big rocking chair, her hands clasped in her lap. "You been gone a long time," she said. "The water bucket's empty. Take it and go fill it at the spring. Time for me to be gettin' up from here and cookin' supper."</p>
          <p id="p_001359" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001359">When he got back from the spring, he found her laying a fire in the kitchen stove.</p>
          <p id="p_001360" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001360">It was nearly dark when he saw his mother coming, and he ran to meet her. She looked at him closely and said, "Bennie, why on earth did you run so fast?"</p>

            <span class="text" id="span_000871" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#span_000871">He could only say breathlessly, "I don't know." He added quickly, "What did you bring me?" Sometimes she brought him a piece of</span>

          <p id="p_001362" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001362">It was a long time before he went to sleep that night.</p>
          <p id="p_001363" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001363">The next day, he stayed outdoors and only went into the house when his grandmother called him to do something for her. She did not notice.</p>
          <p id="p_001364" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001364">On Sunday, his mother did not go to the Fieldses'. In the morning, they went to church. That afternoon, Mr. Joe Bailey drove up to the house in his horse and buggy to take Bennie's mother for a buggy ride. She had put on her pretty blue-flowered dress and her big wide-brimmed black straw hat with the red roses around its crown and the black ribbon that fell over the brim and down her back. She looked very pretty and as pleased as she could be. Bennie wanted to go riding with them. Once, he had asked Mr. Joe if he could go along, and Mr. Joe had grinned and said yes, but Bennie's mother had not been pleased at all, for some reason. This Sunday, after they had gone, his grandmother let him walk the mile and a half down the road to play with James and Robert Lee Stewart.</p>
          <p id="p_001365" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001365">He knew that his grandmother was preparing to die. He came upon her kneeling in prayer beside her bed and its high headboard that almost touched the ceiling. As she sat in her rocking chair, she said the Twenty-third Psalm. He knew only the first verse: "The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want."</p>
          <p id="p_001366" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001366">Now he felt toward his grandmother the way he felt toward certain people, only more so. There was a feeling that made people seem strange--a feeling that came from them to you-- that made you stand away from them. There was Miss Sally Cannon, his teacher. You did not go close to Miss Sally. She made you sit still and always keep your reader or your spelling book open on your desk, or do your arithmetic problems. If she caught you whispering or talking, she called you up to the front of the room and gave you several stinging lashes on your leg or across your back with one of the long switches that always lay across her desk. You did not go close to Miss Sally unless you had to. You did not go close to Dr. Frazier or the Reverend Isaiah Jones. Teachers, doctors, and preachers were special people.</p>
          <p id="p_001367" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001367">You did not go close to white people, either. Sometimes when he and his grandmother went to town, they would stop at the Fieldses'. They would walk up the long green yard and go around the big red brick house, with its tall white columns, to the kitchen, where his mother was; it always seemed a nice place to be, even on a hot summer day. His mother and his grandmother would chuckle over something that Miss Marion Fields or Mr. Ridley Fields had done. They would stop smiling the minute Miss Marion came into the room, and they would become like people waiting in the vestibule of a church for the prayer to be finished so they could go in. He knew that he acted the same way.</p>
          <p id="p_001368" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001368">Miss Marion had light-brown hair and light-brown eyes. His grandmother said that she was like a sparrow, for she was a tiny woman. She always wore a dress that was pretty enough to wear to church. The last time he was at the Fieldses', Miss Marion came into the kitchen. After she had spoken to his grandmother, she turned to him. He was sitting in a chair near the window, and he felt himself stiffen both inside and outside. She said, "I declare, Birdie, Bennie's the prettiest colored child I ever did see. Lashes long as a girl's. Is he a good boy, Hannah?"</p>
          <p id="p_001369" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001369">"He's a quiet child," his grandmother said. "Sometimes I think he's too quiet, but he's a good child--at least when I got my eyes on him." They all laughed.</p>

            <span class="text" id="span_000873" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#span_000873">"I'm sure Bennie's good," Miss Marion said. "Be a good boy, Bennie. Eat plenty and grow</span>

          </p>
          <p id="p_001371" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001371">"Yes, Ma'am," he answered.</p>
          <p id="p_001372" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001372">"Birdie, give him a piece of that lemon pie you baked for supper. Well, Hannah, it's been nice talking with you again. Always stop on your way to town."</p>
          <p id="p_001373" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001373">Two weeks to the day after Dr. Frazier's visit. Miss May Mathis came to see his grandmother. She was much shorter than his grandmother--a plump woman, who always wore long black-and-white checked gingham dresses that fell straight down from her high full breasts to her knees and then flared outward. Her chin was sharp, with folds of flesh around it. Her nose was wide and flat. She had small, snapping black eyes. Her skin was like cream that had been kept too long and into which hundreds of tiny black specks had fallen.</p>
          <p id="p_001374" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001374">As she came into the yard, she asked Bennie if his grandmother was at home. She said she would sit on the porch, where it was cool. He ran into the house to tell his grandmother that she was there.</p>
          <p id="p_001375" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001375">His grandmother put away her sewing and went out on the porch. "May, I'm glad you come. I've been lookin' for you," she said.</p>
          <p id="p_001376" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001376">"I'd been here sooner, but my stomach's been givin' me trouble lately. Sometimes I think my time ain't long."</p>
          <p id="p_001377" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001377">"Hush--hush! You'll live to see me put under the ground."</p>
          <p id="p_001378" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001378">"Well, the day before yesterday I spent half the day in bed. I thought I'd have to send John for you," Miss May answered, and she went into a long account of the illness that troubled her.</p>
          <p id="p_001379" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001379">Bennie got up from the edge of the porch and ran around the house. The two old women paid no attention to his going. He knew what his grandmother would say to Miss May. She would tell Miss May how she wanted to be dressed for burial. She would name the song she wanted to be sung over her. He had heard the same conversation many times. Now it was different. What they were talking about would soon "come to pass," as his grandmother would say. Miss May did not know, but he knew.</p>
          <p id="p_001380" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001380">He went out of the back gate and down the path to the spring. He waded in the stream awhile, catching minnows in his hands and then letting them go. He went across the pasture field. He broke off a persimmon bush to use as a switch, and he chased his grandmother's cow about the pasture a bit. But the cow was old and soon grew tired of moving when he hit her with the switch. Then he went to the big oak tree that stood between the fields and sat down. He stayed there until he saw Miss May Mathis going out of the front gate.</p>
          <p id="p_001381" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001381">The July days went slowly by, one much like another. It grew hotter and hotter.</p>
          <p id="p_001382" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001382">One day when he walked into the house after playing a long time in the stream and the pasture field, he found his grandmother quietly sleeping in her big rocking chair. He saw a bottle full of big white pills on the dresser. It had not been there when he left the house. An empty glass stood beside the pills. He felt too frightened to move. Her breast was rising and falling evenly. She stirred and then opened her eyes.</p>
          <p id="p_001383" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001383">She seemed dazed and not to see him for a moment. Then her lips curved into a queer smile, and a twinkle came into her eyes. "Must have dropped off to sleep like a baby," she said. "Run outdoors and play. I'll set here awhile, and then I'll get up and start supper."</p>
          <p id="p_001384">
            <span class="text" id="span_000875" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#span_000875">Later on, she called him and asked if he</span>
            <pagenum id="p117" page="normal" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p117">117</pagenum>
            <span class="text" id="span_000876" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#span_000876">could make out with milk and cold food from dinner. She left the milking for his mother to do when she came home from the Fieldses'. But the next morning his grandmother was all right, and he thought she was not going to die that summer, after all.</span>
          </p>
          <p id="p_001385" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001385">One morning, a little after his mother had gone to the Fieldses', Mr. John Mathis drove up. He turned his horse and buggy around to face the way he had come. Then he walked up the path to the house. He was a tall, raw-boned man with a bullet-shaped head, and he looked exactly like what he was--a deacon in a church.</p>
          <p id="p_001386" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001386">"What is it, John?" Bennie's grandmother asked.</p>
          <p id="p_001387" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001387">"It's May. She was sick all day yesterday. Last night I had to get the doctor for her. Jennie Stewart's there now."</p>
          <p id="p_001388" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001388">"I'll be ready to go in a minute," his grandmother said.</p>
          <p id="p_001389" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001389">On the way to the Mathises', Bennie sat on the back of the buggy. His grandmother and Mr. John said only a few words. When they reached the house, his grandmother told him to keep very quiet and to be good, and she went inside at once. There were people on the porch, and people continued to come and go. It was midafternoon, and still his grandmother had not come from within the house. A Ford car drove up to the gate. In it were Philomena Jones and her mother. Philomena was a year younger than Bennie. She had a sharp little yellow face, big black eyes that went everywhere, and she wore her hair in two long plaits. "Come on," she said, "and let's play something." When they were out of hearing of the grown-up people, she said, "Miss May going to die."</p>
          <p id="p_001390" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001390">"How do you know?"</p>
          <p id="p_001391" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001391">"I heard my mama say she was. She's old. When you're old you have to die."</p>
          <p id="p_001392" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001392">Next, Philomena said, "Your mama's tryin' to catch Mr. Joe Bailey for a husband. Mama said it's time she's getting another husband if she's ever going to get one."</p>
          <p id="p_001393" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001393">"You stop talkin'!" Bennie told her.</p>
          <p id="p_001394" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001394">"She said you pa's been dead nine years now and if your mama don't hurry and take Mr. Joe Bailey--that is, if she can get him--she may never get a chance to marry again."</p>
          <p id="p_001395" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001395">"If you don't stop talkin', I'll hit you!"</p>
          <p id="p_001396" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001396">"No, you won't. I'm not scared of you, even if you are a boy, and I'll say what I want to. Mama said, 'Birdie Wilson's in her forties, if she a day, and if a woman lets herself get into her forties without marryin', her chance are mighty slim after that.' I'm goin' to marry when I'm twenty."</p>
          <p id="p_001397" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001397">"Nobody'd want you. You talk too much."</p>
          <p id="p_001398" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001398">"I don't, either."</p>
          <p id="p_001399" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001399">"I won't play with you. I'm goin' back to the porch," he said.</p>
          <p id="p_001400" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001400">Philomena stayed in the yard a little longer. She carried on an imaginary conversation with a person who seemed as eager to talk as she. After a while, she ran back to the porch and sat down and gave her attention to what the grown-up people were saying, now and then putting in a word herself.</p>
          <p id="p_001401" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001401">Then his grandmother came out from the house. People stopped talking at the sight of her face. "May's gone," she said.</p>
          <p id="p_001402" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001402">The people on the porch bowed their heads, and their faces became as though they were already at Miss May Mathis's funeral.</p>
          <p id="p_001403" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001403">His grandmother looked very tired. After a moment she said, "The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh. Blessed be the name of the Lord." There was a silence. Then she spoke again. "I thought May would do for me what I have to do for her now." She turned and went back into the house. Some of the women rose and followed her.</p>
          <p id="p_001404">
            <span class="text" id="span_000877" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#span_000877">The people who remained on the porch spoke in low voices. Someone wondered when</span>
            <pagenum id="p118" page="normal" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p118">118</pagenum>
            <span class="text" id="span_000878" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#span_000878">the funeral would be. Someone wondered if Miss May's sister Ethel, who lived in St. Louis, would come. Someone hoped it would not rain the day of the funeral.</span>
          </p>
          <p id="p_001405" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001405">Then Mr. John Mathis and Bennie's grandmother came out on the porch. Mr. John said, "Hannah, you done all you could do. May couldn't have had a better friend. You're tired now. I'll send you home."</p>
          <p id="p_001406" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001406">At home, his grandmother seemed not to notice him. Her eyes seemed to be taking a great sad rest. She sent him to the spring to get water to cook supper.</p>
          <p id="p_001407" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001407">As he walked down the path, he thought about his grandmother. He felt more sorry for her than he felt fear of her. Miss May Mathis was dead; he could not run and get her now.</p>
          <p id="p_001408" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001408">On Sunday afternoon at two o'clock at the Baptist Church, Miss May Mathis's funeral service was held. There was a procession of buggies, surreys, and even a few automobiles from the house to the church. Mr. Joe Bailey came and took Bennie's mother, his grandmother, and him to church. The funeral was a long one. He sat beside his grandmother and listened to the prayers, the songs, and the sermon, all the time dreading the moment when the flowers would be taken from the gray casket, the casket would be opened, and the people would file by to see the body for the last time.</p>
          <p id="p_001409" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001409">The Reverend Isaiah Jones described Heaven as a land flowing with milk and honey, a place where people ate fruit from the tree of life, wore golden slippers, long white robes, and starry crowns, and rested forever. The Reverend Isaiah Jones was certain that Miss May Mathis was there, resting in the arms of Jesus, done with the sins and sorrows of this world. Bennie wondered why Mr. John covered his face with his hands, and why Miss May's sister Ethel, who had come all the way from St. Louis, cried out, and why people cried, if Miss May was so happy in this land. It seemed that they would be glad for her, so glad they would not cry. Or did they cry because they were glad? He could not understand. The Reverend Jones said that they would see Miss May on the Resurrection morning. Bennie could not understand this, either.</p>
          <p id="p_001410" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001410">At last the gray casket was opened, and people began to file by it. And at last he was close. His mother went by, and then Mr. Joe. Now his grandmother. The line of people stopped, waiting expectantly. His grandmother stood and looked down on Miss May for a long time. She did not cry out. She simply stood there and looked down, and finally she moved on. Now he was next. Miss May Mathis looked as though she had simply combed her hair and piled it on top of her head, put on her best black silk dress, pinned her big old brooch to its lace collar, picked up a white handkerchief with one hand, and then decided that instead of going to church she would sleep a little while. As he looked down on her, he was not as afraid as he'd thought he would be.</p>
          <p id="p_001411" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001411">Outside the church, as the procession was forming to go to the graveyard, Dr. Frazier came up to his grandmother and asked how she was.</p>
          <p id="p_001412" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001412">"As well as could be expected, Doctor," his grandmother said. And then, in a low voice, "I've had only one."</p>
          <p id="p_001413" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001413">"You got through it all right."</p>
          <p id="p_001414" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001414">"Yes."</p>
          <p id="p_001415" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001415">"And this?"</p>
          <p id="p_001416" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001416">"I've managed to get through it."</p>
          <p id="p_001417" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001417">"You will be careful."</p>
          <p id="p_001418" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001418">"Yes."</p>
          <p id="p_001419" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001419">"Now?"</p>
          <p id="p_001420" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001420">"He'll have to go to the Stewarts'."</p>

            <span class="text" id="span_000879" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#span_000879">They did not know that he understood what they were talking about, even if none of the other people around them did. He heard two women whispering. One said to the other, "It's</span>

          <p id="p_001422" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001422">Now his grandmother's footsteps were slower as she moved about the house and yard. He kept the garden and the flower beds along the yard fences weeded, the stove box full of wood, the water bucket full all the time, without her having to ask him to do these things for her. He overheard her say to his mother, "Child does everything without being told. It ain't natural."</p>
          <p id="p_001423" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001423">"Reckon he's not well?" his mother asked anxiously.</p>
          <p id="p_001424" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001424">"Don't think so. He eats well. Maybe the trouble is the child don't have nobody to play with every day. He'll be all right when fall comes and school starts."</p>
          <p id="p_001425" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001425">August came, and it grew hotter. The sun climbed up the sky in the morning and down the sky in the evening like a tired old man with a great load on his back going up and down a hill. Then one hot mid-August day dawned far hotter and sultrier than the one just past. It grew still hotter during the early part of the morning, but by midday there was a change, for there was a breeze, and in the west a few dark clouds gathered in the sky. His grandmother said, "I believe the rain will come at last."</p>
          <p id="p_001426" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001426">About three o'clock, the wind rose suddenly. It bent the top of the big oak tree that stood in the yard. There were low rumbles of thunder.</p>
          <p id="p_001427" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001427">"Bennie, Bennie, come! Let's get the chickens up!" his grandmother called to him.</p>
          <p id="p_001428" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001428">By the time the chickens were safe in the henhouse and chicken coops, it was time to go into the house and put the windows down. The wind lifted the curtains almost to the ceiling. They got the windows down. His grandmother went into the kitchen. He went out on the porch. He wanted to watch the clouds, for he had never seen any bigger or blacker or quite so low to the earth--he was sure they must be touching the ground somewhere. He wanted to see what the wind did to the trees, the corn, and the grass.</p>
          <p id="p_001429" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001429">At last the rain fell, first in great drops that were blown onto the edge of the porch by the wind and felt cool and good as they touched his face. They made him want to run out into the yard. Then the rain came so quickly and so heavily, and with it so much wind, that it came up on the porch and almost pushed him back into the house. The thunder roared and there were flashes of lightning.</p>
          <p id="p_001430" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001430">"Bennie, Bennie, where are you?" his grandmother called, and when he went inside she said, "Set down--set down in the big chair there or come into my room if you want to. I'm goin' to just set in my rocker."</p>
          <p id="p_001431" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001431">"I'll stay here," he said, and he went to the big chair near the fireplace and sat down.</p>
          <p id="p_001432" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001432">"There--there--just set there. I'll leave the door open."</p>

            <span class="text" id="span_000884" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#span_000884">The back of the fireplace was wet; water stood on it in drops that looked like tears on a face. He stood and looked at it awhile, then he sat down in the big chair. There was nothing else to do but to sit there.</span>
          </p>
          <p id="p_001436" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001436">He heard her cry out. The cry was sharp and quick. Then it was cut off.</p>
          <p id="p_001437" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001437">She called him. "Bennie! Bennie!" Her voice was thick.</p>
          <p id="p_001438" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001438">He could not move.</p>
          <p id="p_001439" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001439">"Bennie!"</p>
          <p id="p_001440" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001440">He went into the room where she was.</p>
          <p id="p_001441" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001441">She sat on the side of her bed. She was breathing hard, and in one hand she had the bottle of white pills. "Get me a glass of water. One of my spells done come over me."</p>
          <p id="p_001442" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001442">He went into the kitchen and got a glass from the kitchen safe and filled it with water from the bucket that sat on the side table. Then he went back to her and gave her the water.</p>
          <p id="p_001443" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001443">She took it and put two pills in her mouth and gulped them down with the water. She was breathing hard. "Pull off my shoes," she said.</p>
          <p id="p_001444" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001444">As he was unlacing the high-top shoes she always wore, she gave a little cry. He felt her body tremble. "Just a bit of pain. Don't worry. I'm all right," she said. "It's gone," she added a moment later.</p>
          <p id="p_001445" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001445">When he got her shoes off, he lifted her legs onto the bed, and she lay back and closed her eyes. "Go into the front room," she said, "and close the door behind you and stay there until the storm is past. I'm goin' to drop off to sleep--and if I'm still asleep when the storm is over, just let me sleep until your mama comes. Don't come in here. Don't try to wake me. 'Twon't do me no harm to take me a long good sleep."</p>
          <p id="p_001446" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001446">He could not move. He could only stand and stare at her.</p>
          <p id="p_001447" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001447">"Hear me? Go on, I tell you. Go on--don't, I'll get up from here and skin you alive."</p>
          <p id="p_001448" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001448">He crept from the room, closing the door after him.</p>
          <p id="p_001449" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001449">He went to the big chair and sat down. He must not cry. Crying could not help him. There was nothing to do but to sit there until the storm was past.</p>
          <p id="p_001450" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001450">The rain and the wind came steadily now. He sat back in the big chair. He wondered about his mother. Was she safe at the Fieldses'? He wondered if the water had flowed into the henhouse and under the chicken coops, where the little chickens were. If it had, some of the little chickens might get drowned. The storm lasted so long that it began to seem to him that it had always been there.</p>
          <p id="p_001451" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001451">At last he became aware that the room was growing lighter and the rain was not so hard. The thunder and lightning were gone. Then, almost as suddenly as it had begun, the storm was over.</p>
          <p id="p_001452" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001452">He got up and went out on the porch. Everything was clean. Everything looked new. There were little pools of water everywhere, and it was cool. There were a few clouds in the sky, but they were white and light gray. He looked across the field toward Mr. Charley Miller's, and he opened his eyes wide when he saw that the storm had blown down the big oak tree. He started to run back into the house to tell his grandmother that the storm had blown the tree down, and then he stopped. After a minute, he stepped down from the porch. The wet grass felt good on his bare feet.</p>
          <p id="p_001453" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001453">He felt his grandmother in the doorway even before he heard her call. He turned and looked at her. She had put on her shoes and the long apron she always wore. She came out on the porch, and he decided that she looked as though her sleep had done her good.</p>
          <p id="p_001454" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001454">He remembered the tree, and he cried, "Look--look, Grannie! The storm blowed down the tree between your field and Mr. Charley Miller's."</p>
          <pagenum id="p121" page="normal" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p121">121</pagenum>
          <p id="p_001455" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001455">"That tree was there when me and your grandpa came here years and years ago," she said. "The Lord saw fit to let it be blowed down in this storm. I--I----" She broke off and went back into the house.</p>
          <p id="p_001456" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001456">He ran into the house and said to her, "I'm going down to the spring. I bet the stream's deep as a creek."</p>
          <p id="p_001457" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001457">"Don't you get drowned like old Pharaoh's army," she said.</p>
          <p id="p_001458" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001458">The storm drove away the heat, for the days were now filled with cool winds that came and rattled the cornstalks and the leaves on the oak tree in the yard. There were showers. The nights were long and cool; the wind came into the rooms, gently pushing aside the neat white curtains to do so.</p>
          <p id="p_001459" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001459">One morning when he went into the kitchen to get hot water and soap to take to the back porch to wash his face and hands, he found his mother and grandmother busy talking. They stopped the moment they saw him. His mother's face seemed flushed and uncomfortable, but her eyes were very bright.</p>
          <p id="p_001460" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001460">"Done forgot how to say good mornin' to a body?" his grandmother said.</p>
          <p id="p_001461" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001461">"Good mornin', Grannie. Good mornin', Mama."</p>
          <p id="p_001462" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001462">"That's more like it."</p>
          <p id="p_001463" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001463">"Good mornin', Bennie," his mother said. She looked at him, and he had a feeling that she was going to come to him and take him in her arms the way she used to do when he was a little boy. But she did not.</p>
          <p id="p_001464" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001464">His grandmother laughed. "Well, son, Mr. Joe Bailey went and popped the question to your mama last night."</p>
          <p id="p_001465" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001465">His mother blushed. He did not know what to say to either of them. He just stood and looked at them.</p>
          <p id="p_001466" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001466">"What you goin' to say to that?" his mother said.</p>
          <p id="p_001467" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001467">All he could think to say was "It's all right."</p>
          <p id="p_001468" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001468">His grandmother laughed again, and his mother smiled at him the way she did when he ran down the road to meet her and asked her to let him carry the packages that she had.</p>
          <p id="p_001469" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001469">"When will they be married?" he asked.</p>
          <p id="p_001470" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001470">"Soon," his mother said.</p>
          <p id="p_001471" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001471">"Where will they live-here?"</p>
          <p id="p_001472" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001472">"That ain't been settled yet," his grandmother said. "Nothin' been settled. They just got engaged last night while they were settin' in the front room and you was sleepin' in your bed. Things can be settled later." She gave a sigh that his mother did not hear. But he heard it.</p>
          <p id="p_001473" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001473">He poured water from the teakettle into the wash pan and took the pan out on the back porch and washed and dried his hands. He looked across the fields and hills. The sun had not come up yet, but the morning lay clear and soft and quiet as far as his eyes could see.</p>
          <p id="p_001474" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001474">His mother was going to marry Mr. Joe Bailey. He did mind a little. He knew that was what she wanted. He liked Mr. Joe. When Mr. Joe smiled at him, he always had to smile back at him; something seemed to make him do so.</p>
          <p id="p_001475" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001475">After his mother had gone to the Fieldses', he and his grandmother sat down to breakfast at the table in the kitchen. His grandmother never ate a meal without saying grace. Usually she gave thanks just for the food that they were about to eat. This morning she asked the Lord to bless his mama, Mr. Joe, and him, and she thanked the Lord for answering all her prayers.</p>
          <p id="p_001476">
            <span class="text" id="span_000885" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#span_000885">As they ate, she talked to him. She spoke as though she were talking to herself, expecting no answer from him, but he knew that she meant for him to listen to her words, and he knew why she was talking to him. "Joe Bailey will make your mama a good husband and you a good father to take the place of your father</span>
            <pagenum id="p122" page="normal" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p122">122</pagenum>
            <span class="text" id="span_000886" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#span_000886">who you never knew. The Lord took your father when your father was still young, but that was the Lord's will. Joe Bailey will be good to you, for he is a good man. Mind him. Don't make trouble between him and your mama. Hear me?"</span>
          </p>
          <p id="p_001477" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001477">"Yes, Ma'am."</p>
          <p id="p_001478" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001478">"Don't you worry about where you'll stay. You'll be with your mama. Hear me?"</p>
          <p id="p_001479" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001479">"Yes'm."</p>
          <p id="p_001480" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001480">She sat silent for a moment, and then she added, "Well, no matter if your mama is going to marry Mr. Joe Bailey. We got to work today just like we always has. No matter what comes, we have to do the little things that our hands find to do. Soon as you finish eatin', go to the spring and get water and fill the pot and the tubs."</p>
          <p id="p_001481" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001481">August drew toward its close, but the soft cool days stayed on, and they were calm and peaceful. His grandmother cooked the meals, and washed and ironed their own clothes and those that his mother brought home from the Fieldses' and Mr. Charley Miller's. Sometimes Bennie wondered if she had put from her mind the things that Dr. Frazier had said to her that day he listened under the window. Sometimes it seemed to him that he had never crept close to the window and listened to her and Dr. Frazier. The summer seemed just like last summer and the summer before that.</p>
          <p id="p_001482" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001482">One day near the end of the month, Mr. John Mathis stopped by the house on his way to town. He was on horseback, riding a big black horse whose sides glistened. He hailed Bennie's grandmother, and she came out on the porch to pass the time of day with him.</p>
          <p id="p_001483" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001483">"Ever see such a fine summer day, John?" she said.</p>
          <p id="p_001484" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001484">"It's not a summer day, Hannah. It's a fall day. It's going to be an early fall this year."</p>
          <p id="p_001485" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001485">"Think so?" his grandmother asked. Her face changed, but Mr. John did not notice.</p>
          <p id="p_001486" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001486">"I can feel it. I can feel it in the air. The smell of fall is here already." Then they fell to talking about the church and people they knew.</p>
          <p id="p_001487" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001487">She stood on the porch and watched Mr. John ride up the road on his big black horse. Often that day, she came out on the porch and stood and looked across the fields and hills.</p>
          <p id="p_001488" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001488">When Bennie went outside for the first time the next morning and looked around him, he did not see a single cloud in the sky. The quiet that lay about him felt like a nice clean sheet you pull over your head before you go to sleep at night that shuts out everything to make a space both warm and cool just for you. The day grew warm. A little after midday, clouds began to float across the sky, but for the most part it remained clear and very blue. He played in the yard under the oak tree, and then he went down to the spring and played. In the afternoon, he rolled his hoop up and down the road in front of the house. He grew tired of this and went and sat under the tree.</p>
          <p id="p_001489" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001489">He was still sitting under the tree when his grandmother cried out. She gave a sharp sudden cry, like the cry people make when they've been stung by a bee or a wasp. He got to his feet. Then he heard her call. "Bennie! Bennie!"</p>
          <p id="p_001490" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001490">He ran into the house and into her room.</p>
          <p id="p_001491" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001491">She sat in her big rocking chair, leaning forward a little, her hands clutching the arms of the chair. She was breathing hard. He had never seen her eyes as they were now. "Water-the pills-in the dresser."</p>
          <p id="p_001492" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001492">He ran into the kitchen and got a glass of water and ran back to the room and gave it to her and then went to the dresser and got the bottle of pills. He unscrewed the top and took out two of them and gave them to her.</p>
          <p id="p_001493">
            <span class="text" id="span_000887" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#span_000887">She put the pills in her mouth and gulped</span>

            <span class="text" id="span_000888" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#span_000888">them down with water. Then she leaned back and closed her eyes.

            <p id="p_001522" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001522">A writer may sometimes tell a story in the third person from the point of view of a character in the story. "Before the End of Summer" is told from the point of view of Bennie.</p>
            <p id="p_001523" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001523">Because Bennie is only ten years old, there are many things he does not understand. At the funeral service of May Mathis, he is confused by the mourners' grief when they are told that Miss May is in heaven:</p>
            <p id="p_001524" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001524">Bennie wondered why Mr. John covered his face with his hands, and why Miss May's sister Ethel, who had come all the way from St. Louis, cried out, and why people cried, if Miss May was so happy in this land. It seemed that they would be glad for her, so glad they would not cry. Or did they cry because they were glad? He could not understand.</p>
            <p id="p_001525" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001525">The language of the story is also carefully controlled so that Bennie's thoughts are conveyed realistically:</p>
            <p id="p_001526" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001526">He went to the big chair and sat down. He must not cry. Crying could not help him. There was nothing to do but to sit there until the storm was past.</p>
            <p id="p_001527" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001527">The rain and the wind came steadily now. He sat back in the big chair. He wondered about his mother. Was she safe at the Fieldses'? He wondered if the water had flowed into the henhouse and under the chicken coops, where the little chickens were. If it had, some of the little chickens might get drowned. The storm lasted so long that it began to seem to him that it had always been there.</p>

Because the story is told from Bennie's point of view, we know his thoughts and feelings about things that happen, sometimes through his actions rather than through his words. Write a paper in which you trace Bennie's reactions to his grandmother's impending death. Use details from the story, and be sure to use quotation marks for any direct quotations from the story.</p>

          <p id="p_001549" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001549">Jess sighed, then sniffed the pies, so rich with ripe peach flavor that the kitchen smelled like a summer orchard, nothing lacking but the sound of bees. "Now, Eliza," he said, "thee knows I wouldn't have thee anyways altered. Thee..."</p>
          <p id="p_001550" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001550">"Thee," Eliza interrupted him, "is like all men. Thee wants to have thy poetry and eat it too."</p>
          <p id="p_001551" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001551">Jess wondered how what he'd felt about spring, a season with the Lord's thumb- print fresh on it, could've led to anything so unspringlike as an argument about a batch of dried-peach pies.</p>
          <p id="p_001552" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001552">"Eliza," he said firmly, "I didn't mean thee. Though it's crossed my mind sometimes as strange that none of the boys have ever turned, this time of year, to rhyming."</p>
          <p id="p_001553" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001553">"Josh writes poems," Eliza said.</p>
          <p id="p_001554" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001554">"Thee ever read what Josh writes, Eliza?"</p>
          <p id="p_001555" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001555">Eliza nodded.</p>
          <p id="p_001556" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001556">Ah, well, Jess thought, no use at this late date to tell her what's the difference.</p>
          <p id="p_001557" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001557">Eliza looked her husband over carefully "Jess Birdwell," she said, "thee's full of humors. Thy blood needs thinning. I'll boil thee up a good cup of sassafras tea."</p>
          <p id="p_001558" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001558">Jess turned away from the green and gold sunset and the patches of snow it was gilding and fairly faced the dried-peach pies and Eliza, who was dropping dumplings into a pot of beans.</p>
          <p id="p_001559" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001559">"That's just it, Eliza," he said. "That's just the rub."</p>
          <p id="p_001560" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00005.smil#p_001560">Eliza gave him no encouragement, but he went on anyway. "Earth alters, season to season, spring comes in never two times the same, only us pounding on steady as pump bolts and not freshened by so much as a grass blade."</p>

          <p id="p_001564" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001564">Eliza pulled a chair out from the table and sat. "Jess, why's thee always been so set against geese?"</p>
          <p id="p_001565" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001565">"I'm not set against geese. It's geese that's set against farming. They can mow down a half-acre of sprouting corn while thee's trying to head them off--and in two minutes they'll level a row of pie plant it's taken two years to get started. No, Eliza, it's the geese that's against me."</p>
          <p id="p_001566" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001566">"If thee had tight fences..." Eliza said.</p>
          <p id="p_001567" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001567">"Eliza, I got tight fences, but the goose's never been hatched that'll admit fences exist. And an old gander'd just as soon go through a fence as hiss--and if he can't find a hole or crack in a fence he'll lift the latch."</p>
          <p id="p_001568" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001568">"Jess," said Eliza flatly, "thee don't like geese."</p>
          <p id="p_001569" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001569">"Well," said Jess, "I wouldn't go so far's to say I didn't like them, but I will say that if there's any meaner, dirtier animal, or one that glories in it more, I don't know it. And a thing I've never been able to understand about thee, Eliza, is what thee sees in the shifty-eyed birds."</p>
          <p id="p_001570" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001570">"Geese," said Eliza, with a dreaminess unusual to her, "march along so lordly like... they're pretty as swans floating down a branch ... in fall they stretch out their necks and honk to geese passing overhead as if they's wild. My father never had any trouble raising geese and I've heard him say many a time that there's no better food for a brisk morning than a fried goose egg."</p>
          <p id="p_001571" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001571">Jess knew, with spring his topic, he'd ought to pass over Eliza's father and his fried goose egg but he couldn't help saying, "A fried goose egg always had a kind of bloated look to me, Eliza"--but then he went on fast. "The season's shaping up," he said. "I can see thee's all primed to say, 'Jess, let's get a setting of goose eggs.'"</p>
          <p id="p_001572" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001572">Eliza went over to the bean kettle and began to lift out dumplings. "It's a forwarder season than thee thinks, Jess," she said. "I got a setting under a hen now."</p>
          <p id="p_001573" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001573">Jess looked at his wife. He didn't know what had made him want spring's variety in a human being--nor Eliza's substituting doing for asking. And speaking of it just now, as he had, made opposition kind of ticklish.</p>
          <p id="p_001574" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001574">"When'd thee set them?" he asked finally.</p>
          <p id="p_001575" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001575">"Yesterday," said Eliza.</p>
          <p id="p_001576" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001576">"Where'd thee get the eggs?"</p>
          <p id="p_001577" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001577">"Overbys'," said Eliza. The Overbys were their neighbors to the south.</p>
          <p id="p_001578" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001578">"Well, they got enough for a surety," Jess said, "to give a few away."</p>
          <p id="p_001579" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001579">"The Overbys don't give anything away, as thee knows. I paid for them. With my own money," Eliza added.</p>
          <p id="p_001580" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001580">"How many?" Jess asked.</p>
          <p id="p_001581" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001581">"Eight," Eliza said.</p>
          <p id="p_001582" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001582">Jess turned back to his window. The sun had set, leaving a sad green sky and desolate black and white earth. "Five acres of corn gone," he calculated.</p>
          <p id="p_001583" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001583">"Thee said," Eliza reminded him, "that what thee wanted was a little variety in me. 'Steady as a pump bolt,' were thy words."</p>
          <p id="p_001584" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001584">"I know I did," Jess admitted glumly. "I talk too much."</p>
          <p id="p_001585" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001585">"Draw up thy chair," Eliza said placidly, not contradicting him; "here's Enoch and the boys."</p>

          <p id="p_001590" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001590">"Goose on the table's not what I mean," Jess said. "I was speaking of goose on the hoof. Goose nipping off a stand of corn, Enoch, goose roistering round, honking and hissing so's thee can't hear thyself think, goose eyeing thee like a snake on stilts."</p>
          <p id="p_001591" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001591">Enoch gazed at his employer for a few seconds. "Mr. Birdwell," he said, "I think that if they's an ornery bird, it's a goose. Ornery and undependable."</p>
          <p id="p_001592" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001592">"I'm glad we's so like-minded about them," Jess said. "Otherwise, I'd not like to ask thee to do this little job." He pulled a long darning needle from beneath the lapel of his coat.</p>
          <p id="p_001593" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001593">Enoch eyed it with some mistrust. "I can't say's I've been handy with a needle, Mr. Birdwell."</p>
          <p id="p_001594" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001594">"Thee'll be handy enough for this," Jess said with hearty conviction. "To come to it, Enoch, Eliza's set eight goose eggs. Next year with any luck she'd have two dozen. And so on. More and more. Feeling the way thee does, Enoch, about geese, it's no more'n fair to give thee a chance to put a stop to this before it goes too far. One little puncture in each egg with this and the goose project's nipped in the bud and Eliza none the wiser."</p>
          <p id="p_001595" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001595">"I'm mighty awkward with my hands," said Enoch, "doing fine work. Ticklish job like this I might drop an egg and break it."</p>

          <p id="p_001600" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001600">"Likely no need to do a thing," Enoch said. "Two to one those eggs'll never hatch anyways. Overbys're such a fox-eared tribe they more'n likely sold her bad eggs to begin with."</p>

          <p id="p_001606" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001606">Enoch took the needle, held it somewhat gingerly, and with the sun glinting across its length walked slowly toward the chicken house.</p>
          <p id="p_001607" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001607">It takes thirty days for a goose egg to hatch, and the time, with spring work to be done, went fast.

          <p id="p_001614" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001614">Eliza was surprised, for Jess'd usually come twice as far for a hot dinner at midday, but she made him fried-ham sandwiches and put them and some cold apple turnovers in a bag.</p>
          <p id="p_001615" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001615">"It's a pity thee has to miss thy dinner," she told him, but Jess only said, "Press of work, press of work," and hurriedly departed.</p>
          <p id="p_001616" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001616">Jess came home that evening through the spring twilight, somewhat late, and found a number of things to do at the barn before he went up to the house. When he entered the kitchen nothing seemed amiss--lamps ruddy, table set, stove humming, and beside the stove a small box over which Eliza was bending. Jess stopped to look--and listen; from inside the box was coming a kind of birdlike peeping, soft and not unpleasant. Reluctantly he walked to Eliza's side. There, eating minced boiled egg, and between bites lifting its beak to Eliza, it seemed, and making those chirping sounds he'd heard, was a gray-gold gosling. Eliza looked up pleasantly. "Enoch was right," she said. "The eggs were bad. Only one hatched. I plan to call it Samantha," she told Jess. "It's a name I've always been partial to."</p>
          <p id="p_001617" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001617">"Samantha," said Jess without any enthusiasm whatever for either name or gosling. "How's thee know it's a she?"</p>
          <p id="p_001618" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001618">"I don't," said Eliza, "but if it's a gander it's a name easily changed to Sam."</p>
          <p id="p_001619" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001619">Enoch came in just then with a load of wood for the kitchen woodbox. "Enoch," asked Jess, "has thee seen Samantha--or Sam?"</p>
          <p id="p_001620" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001620">Enoch mumbled but Jess understood him to say he had.</p>
          <p id="p_001621" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001621">"It was my understanding, Enoch, that thy opinion was that all those eggs were bad."</p>
          <p id="p_001622" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001622">"Well, Mr. Birdwell," said Enoch, "a man could make a mistake. He could count wrong."</p>
          <p id="p_001623" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001623">"A man ought to be able to count to eight without going astray," said Jess.</p>
          <p id="p_001624" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001624">Eliza was paying no attention to either of them; she was making little tweeting sounds herself, bending over the chirping gosling. "Does thee know," she asked Jess, "that this is the first pet I ever had in my life?"</p>
          <p id="p_001625" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001625">"Thee's got Ebony," Jess said.</p>
          <p id="p_001626" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001626">"I don't mean a caged pet," Eliza said, "but one to walk beside thee. I'm reconciled the others didn't hatch. With eight I'd've had to raise geese for the table. With one only I can make Samantha a pure pet."</p>
          <p id="p_001627">
            <span class="text" id="span_000924" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#span_000924">A pure pet was what she made of her: Samantha ate what the family ate, with the exception of articles which Eliza thought might be indigestible and would risk on humans but not on her goose. Cake, pie, corn on the cob, there was nothing too good for Samantha. From a big-footed, gold-downed gosling she swelled, almost at once, like a slack sail which gets a sudden breeze, into a full-rounded convexity. "Emphasis on the vexity," Jess said when he</span>
            <pagenum id="p130" page="normal" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p130">130</pagenum>
            <span class="text" id="span_000925" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#span_000925">thought of this. Samantha was everything he'd disliked in the general run of geese, with added traits peculiar to herself, which vexed him. Because she was fed at the doorstep, she was always underfoot. No shout, however loud, would move her before she's ready to move. If she's talked to too strong she'd flail you with her wings and pinch the calf of your leg until for some days it would look to be mortifying. She'd take food out of children's hands, and the pansies Jess had planted in a circle at the base of the Juneberry tree she sheared so close that there was not a naked stem left to show for all his work. And when not being crossed in any way, Jess simply looking at her and meditating, trying to fathom Samantha's fascination for Eliza, the goose would suddenly extend her snakelike neck, and almost touching Jess, hiss with such a hint of icy disapprobation that Jess would involuntarily recoil.</span>

          <p id="p_001633" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001633">"Well, did thee fetch her home?" Jess asked.</p>
          <p id="p_001634" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001634">"No," said Eliza with righteous indignation, "they wouldn't let me. They said they had forty geese--and forty's what they got now, and they don't think Samantha's there. They provoked me so, Jess, I told them they'd sold me seven bad eggs and now they try to take the eighth away from me."</p>
          <p id="p_001635" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001635">Jess felt a little abashed at this, but he asked, "How can thee be so sure Samantha's there? She might've been carried off by a varmint."</p>
          <p id="p_001636" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001636">Eliza was scornful. "Thee forgets I hand-raised Samantha from a gosling. I'd know her among four hundred--let alone forty."</p>
          <p id="p_001637" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001637">"Whyn't thee buy her back then," Jess asked, "if that's the only way?"</p>
          <p id="p_001638" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001638">"After what I said about their eggs," Eliza answered sadly, "the Overbys say they don't want any more dealings with me."</p>
          <p id="p_001639" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001639">Eliza mourned so for the lost Samantha that first Enoch and then Jess went over to the Overbys' but no one there would admit the presence of a visiting goose--forty they had, and forty you could see by counting was what they had now. Short of force there didn't seem any way of getting Samantha home again.</p>
          <p id="p_001640" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001640">When Eliza heard the Overbys were going to sell geese for Christmas eating she was frantic. "Jess," she said, "I just can't bear to think of Samantha, plucked naked and resting on a table waiting to be carved. She used to sing as sweet as any bird when she was little, and she'd walk by my side taking the air. She's the only goose I ever heard of," Eliza remembered mournfully, "who'd drink tea."</p>
          <p id="p_001641" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001641">In Jess's opinion a goose'd eat anything at either end of the scale, but he didn't suppose this was a suitable time to mention it to Eliza. "Eliza," he said, "short of me and Enoch's going over there and using force on old man Overby--or sneaking over at night and breaking into their chicken pen, I don't know how in the world we're going to get Samantha back for thee."</p>
          <p id="p_001642" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001642">"We could sue," said Eliza.</p>
          <p id="p_001643" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001643">"Thee mean go to law?" Jess asked, astounded. Quakers stayed out of courts, believing in amicable settlements without recourse to law.</p>
          <p id="p_001644" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001644">"Yes," said Eliza. "I'd do it for Samantha. I'd think it my duty. Going to law'd be a misery for us ... but not so lasting a misery as being roasted would be for Samantha."</p>
          <p id="p_001645" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001645">Jess couldn't deny this, but he said, "I'd have to think it over. I've never been to law yet in my life and suing for a gone goose don't seem to me a very likely place to start."</p>

They stared at Eliza, exchanged salutes with Milt Overby and inspected Samantha, who in her crate awaited the court's decision.</p>

          <p id="p_001670" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001670">Eliza, Jess saw, was of no such opinion. She, too, was scanning the young judge, and Jess, who knew her, saw from the look on her face that she was taken by him. A neat, thin, pious boy--far from home--he looked, no doubt, to her; a young man who could do with better cooking and more regular eating.</p>
          <p id="p_001671" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001671">The young man rapped the court to order. Spitting and shuffling slackened and in a high, precise voice he read, "Birdwell versus Overby. Charge, petty larceny. Appropriation and willful withholding of goose named Samantha." The name Samantha seemed to somewhat choke him, but he got it out.</p>
          <p id="p_001672" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001672">"Ready for Birdwell," said Mr. Abel Samp, Eliza's lawyer.</p>
          <p id="p_001673" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001673">"Ready for Overby," said the defendant's lawyer.</p>
          <p id="p_001674" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001674">Eliza was the first witness on the stand. Jess sometimes forgot what a good-looking woman Eliza was, but the interest shown on lifted faces all about him refreshed his memory.</p>
          <p id="p_001675" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001675">"Swear the plaintiff in," the judge said.</p>
          <p id="p_001676" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001676">Eliza, in her sweet voice, spoke directly to the judge. "I don't swear," she said.</p>
          <p id="p_001677" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001677">The judge explained that profanity was not asked for. "I understood," said Eliza, "that thee wasn't asking for profanity. No one would think that of thee. But we Quakers do not take oaths in court. We affirm."</p>
          <p id="p_001678" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001678">"Permit Mrs. Birdwell to affirm," said the judge. Eliza affirmed.</p>
          <p id="p_001679" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001679">Mr. Samp then proceeded to question Eliza as to Samantha's birth and habits.</p>
          <p id="p_001680" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001680">"Judge," Eliza began.</p>
          <p id="p_001681" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001681">"Address the judge," Mr. Samp said, "as Your Honor."</p>
          <p id="p_001682" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001682">"We Quakers," Eliza told the judge, gently, "do not make use of such titles. What is thy name? I think thee'll go far in our state and thy name's one I'd like to know."</p>
          <p id="p_001683" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001683">The judge appeared somewhat distraught, undecided as to whether to make the tone of the court brisk and legal (if possible) or to follow Eliza's lead of urbane sociability.</p>
          <p id="p_001684" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001684">"Pomeroy," he said and made a slight bow in Eliza's direction.</p>
          <p id="p_001685" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001685">Eliza returned the bow, deeper and with more grace. "Friend Pomeroy," she said, "it is indeed a pleasure to know thee."</p>
          <p id="p_001686" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001686">Samantha's story as Eliza told it to Friend Pomeroy was surprisingly terse. Affecting, and losing nothing by Eliza's telling, but to the point.</p>
          <p id="p_001687" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001687">"Mrs. Birdwell," said Samp, "how long have you had an acquaintanceship with geese and their habits?"</p>
          <p id="p_001688" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001688">"Since I was a child," Eliza said. "My father was a great fancier of geese."</p>
          <p id="p_001689" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001689">"And you think you could identify this goose Samantha, which you admit in looks was similar to the defendant's?"</p>
          <p id="p_001690" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001690">"I could," Eliza said with much authority.</p>
          <p id="p_001691" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001691">Mr. Samp, to Jess's surprise, left the matter there. "Take the witness," he said to Overby's lawyer--but the counsel for the defendant was in no hurry to cross-examine Eliza. Instead he put his client on the stand.</p>
          <p id="p_001692" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001692">"Farewell, Samantha," Jess said to Enoch.</p>
          <p id="p_001693" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001693">"You relieved?" Enoch asked.</p>
          <p id="p_001694" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001694">"Putting Eliza first," Jess said, "as I do, no."</p>

She'd said she knew geese and her testimony had been direct and positive. "Mrs. Birdwell," he said, "how can you be so sure your goose was with my client's geese?"</p>
          <p id="p_001700" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001700">Eliza's black eyes rested confidingly upon the judge. "Friend Pomeroy," she said, "I raised Samantha from a gosling."</p>
          <p id="p_001701" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001701">Jess sighed. "Here it comes," he said, "how that goose could sing and drink tea."</p>
          <p id="p_001702" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001702">Eliza continued, "And there's one thing about her that always set her apart from every other goose."</p>
          <p id="p_001703" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001703">"Yes, Mrs. Birdwell," said Judge Pomeroy, who was inclined to forget, with Eliza on the stand, that he was in a courtroom.</p>
          <p id="p_001704" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001704">"Samantha," said Eliza, with much earnestness, "from the day she was born had a gait unlike any other goose I ever saw and one that set her apart from all her Overby connections. I picked her out at once when I went over there, because of it. Thee couldn't've missed it, Friend Pomeroy."</p>
          <p id="p_001705" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001705">"Yes, Mrs. Birdwell," said the judge with interest in his voice.</p>
          <p id="p_001706" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001706">"Samantha," said Eliza, "was a born pacer. Thee knows what a pacer is?"</p>

          <p id="p_001707" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001707">"Certainly," said Judge Pomeroy. "A pacer," he repeated with no surprise--and with obvious pleasure that Eliza'd hit upon so clear and differentiating an aspect of her goose and one that made identification possible.</p>
          <p id="p_001708" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001708">A titter was mounting through the courtroom-Judge Pomeroy lifted his head. He had no desire to be further instructed as to the history, habits, and breeds of geese, and he liked to see a trial settled by some such little and too often overlooked subtlety. Judge Pomeroy brought down his gavel. "The court awards decision in favor of the plaintiff. Case dismissed." While the silence that followed on his words still prevailed Judge Pomeroy stepped briskly and with obvious pleasure out through the rear door.</p>

No use lingering until Friend Pomeroy had been more thoroughly informed as to gaits in general and geese in particular. Midafternoon's a quiet time in any season.

          <p id="p_001712" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001712">Enoch ceased to meditate and listened. He had been wondering about this himself.</p>
          <p id="p_001713" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001713">"Certainly not," said Eliza. "Thee knows as well as I, Jess Birdwell, an animal can't trot without hind feet and forefeet."</p>
          <p id="p_001714" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001714">"So far, Eliza," Jess said, "we see eye to eye. Now maybe thee'd tell me--did thee ever see a goose that didn't pace?"</p>
          <p id="p_001715" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001715">Eliza was truly amazed, it seemed. "Why, Jess," she said, "an ordinary goose just walks-- but Samantha paces."</p>
          <p id="p_001716" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001716">Jess was silent for a spell. "What'd thee say the difference is?"</p>
          <p id="p_001717" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001717">"It's the swing, Jess Birdwell," said Eliza, "same as in a horse that nature's formed for a pacer ... it's the natural bent, the way the spirit leads the beast to set his feet down. Samantha's a natural pacer."</p>
          <p id="p_001718" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001718">That seemed as far as they'd likely get on the subject and Jess joined Enoch in meditation. In the barnyard, before she went up to the house, Eliza said, like an old hand at the business, "Attending court whettens the appetite. It's a little early but I thought if thee'd relish it"-and she looked at Jess and Enoch, never sparing a glance for Samantha, as if her menfolk's welfare was her sole concern-"I'd stir us up a bite to eat. Hot tea and fresh sweetcakes, say. Might fry a little sausage and open some cherry preserves. If thee'd relish it," she repeated.</p>
          <p id="p_001719" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001719">Jess wasn't taken in, but he'd relish it, and so would Enoch, and they both said so. They hustled with the unhitching so they could uncrate Samantha and note her progress with eyes newly instructed as to what made a pacer. Jess dumped her in the snow, and Enoch tapped her with his hat. Samantha made for the back door.</p>

The air was still and cold, and in it settled the mute darkness and greater cold of night. High in the air there was wind, for through the veil of the dusk the clouds could be seen gliding rapidly south and changing shapes. A sensation of torment, of two-sided, unpredictable nature, arose from the stillness of the earth air beneath the violence of the upper air. Out of the sunset, through the dead, matted grass and isolated weed stalks of the prairie, crept the narrow and deeply rutted remains of a road. In the road, in places, there were crusts of shallow, brittle ice. There were little islands of an old oiled pavement in the road too, but most of it was mud, now frozen rigid. The frozen mud still bore the toothed impress of great tanks, and a wanderer on the neighboring undulations might have stumbled, in this light, into large, partially filled-in and weed-grown cavities, their banks channeled and beginning to spread into badlands.</span>

The creek was already silent under ice. Into the bank above it was dug a sort of cell, with a single opening, like the mouth of a mine tunnel. Within the cell there was a little red of fire, which showed dully through the opening, like a reflection or a deception of the imagination. The light came from the chary burning of four blocks of poorly aged peat, which gave off a petty warmth and much acrid smoke. But the precious remnants of wood, old fence posts and timbers from the long-deserted dugouts, had to be saved for the real cold, for the time when a man's breath blew white, the moisture in his nostrils stiffened at once when he stepped out, and the expansive blizzards paraded for days over the vast open, swirling and settling and thickening, till the dawn of the cleared day when the sky was a thin blue-green and the terrible cold, in which a man could not live for three hours unwarmed, lay over the uniformly drifted swell of the plain.</p>

Behind them, traversed by their shadows, was the earth bench, with two old and dirty army blankets, where the owner of the cell slept. In a niche in the opposite wall were a few tin utensils which caught the glint of the coals. The host was rewrapping in a piece of daubed burlap, four fine, leather-bound books. He worked slowly and very carefully, and at last tied the bundle securely with a piece of grass-woven cord. The other three looked intently upon the process, as if a great</span>

He was an old man, his long, matted beard and hair gray to nearly white. The shadows made his brows and cheekbones appear gnarled, his eyes and cheeks deeply sunken. His big hands, rough with frost and swollen by rheumatism, were awkward but gentle at their task. He was like a prehistoric priest performing a fateful ceremonial rite. Also his voice had in it a suitable quality of deep, reverent despair, yet perhaps, at the moment, a sharpness of selfish satisfaction.</span>

Even in that light the others could see that the threads of the records were becoming worn. Slowly he read out the titles, and the tremendous, dead names of the composers and the artists and the orchestras. The three worked upon the names in their minds, carefully. It was difficult to select from such a wealth what they would at once most like to remember. Finally the man who wanted to write named Gershwin's "New York."</p>

Even the musician lifted his head in amazement, but then quickly bowed it again, strainingly, as if he were suffering from a pain he might not be able to endure. They were all listening deeply, without movement. The wet, blue-green notes tinkled forth from the old machine, and were individual, delectable presences in the cell. The individual, delectable presences swept into a sudden tide of unbearably beautiful dissonance, and then continued fully the swelling and ebbing of that tide, the dissonant inpourings, and the resolutions, and the di-minishments, and the little, quiet wavelets of interlude lapping between. Every sound was piercing and singularly sweet. In all the men except the musician, there occurred rapid sequences of tragically heightened recollection. He heard nothing but what was there. At the final, whispering disappearance, but moving quietly, so that the others would not hear him and look at him, he let his head fall back in agony, as if it were drawn there by the hair, and clenched the fingers of one hand over his teeth. He sat that way while the others were silent, and until they began to breathe again normally. His drawn-up legs were trembling violently.</p>

Then quickly and quietly, looking at the piece of canvas frequently, he slipped the records into the case, snapped the lid shut, and carried the phonograph to his couch. There, pausing often to stare at the canvas and listen, he dug earth from the wall and disclosed a piece of board. Behind this there was a deep hole in the wall, into which he put the phonograph. After a moment's consideration, he went over and reached down his bundle of books and inserted it also. Then, guardedly, he once more sealed up the hole with the board and the earth. He also changed his blankets, and the grass-stuffed sack which served as a pillow, so that he could lie facing the entrance.

          <p id="p_001870" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00006.smil#p_001870">George Stoyonovich was a neighborhood boy who had quit high school on an impulse when he was sixteen, run out of patience, and though he was ashamed every time he went looking for a job, when people asked him if he had finished and he had to say no, he never went back to school. This summer was a hard time for jobs and he had none. Having so much time on his hands, George thought of going to summer school, but the kids in his classes would be too young. He also considered registering in a night high school, only he didn't like the idea of the teachers always telling him what to do. He felt they had not respected him. The result was he stayed off the streets and in his room most of the day. He was close to twenty and had needs with the neighborhood girls, but no money to spend, and he couldn't get more than an occasional few cents because his father was poor, and his sister Sophie, who resembled George, a tall bony girl of twenty-three, earned very little and what she had she kept for herself. Their mother was dead, and Sophie had to take care of the house.</p>

          <p id="p_001877" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_001877">"Some," George answered, although he really didn't. He had tried to read a book or two that Sophie had in the house but found he was in no mood for them. Lately he couldn't stand made-up stories, they got on his nerves. He wished he had some hobby to work at--as a kid he was good in carpentry, but where could he work at it? Sometimes during the day he went for walks, but mostly he did his walking after the hot sun had gone down and it was cooler in the streets.</p>
          <p id="p_001878" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_001878">In the evening after supper George left the house and wandered in the neighborhood. During the sultry days some of the storekeepers and their wives sat in chairs on the thick, broken sidewalks in front of their shops, fanning themselves, and George walked past them and the guys hanging out on the candy-store corner. A couple of them he had known his whole life, but nobody recognized each other. He had no place special to go, but generally, saving it till the last, he left the neighborhood and walked for blocks till he came to a darkly lit little park with benches and trees and an iron railing, giving it a feeling of privacy. He sat on a bench here, watching the leafy trees and the flowers blooming on the inside of the railing, thinking of a better life for himself. He thought of the jobs he had had since he had quit school--delivery boy, stock clerk, runner, lately working in a factory--and he was dissatisfied with all of them. He felt he would someday like to have a good job and live in a private house with a porch, on a street with trees. He wanted to have some dough in his pocket to buy things with, and a girl to go with, so as not to be so lonely, especially on Saturday nights. He wanted people to like and respect him. He thought about these things often but mostly when he was alone at night. Around midnight he got up and drifted back to his hot and stony neighborhood.</p>

          <p id="p_001882" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_001882">Once in a while Mr. Cattanzara came home drunk, but it was a quiet drunk. He never made any trouble, only walked stiffly up the street and slowly climbed the stairs into the hall. Though drunk, he looked the same as always, except for his tight walk, the quietness, and that his eyes were wet. George liked Mr. Cattanzara because he remembered him giving him nickels to buy lemon ice with when he was a squirt. Mr. Cattanzara was a different type than those in the neighborhood. He asked different questions than the others when he met you, and he seemed to know what went on in all the newspapers. He read them, as his fat sick wife watched from the window.</p>
          <p id="p_001883" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_001883">"What are you doing with yourself this summer, George?" Mr. Cattanzara asked. "I see you walkin' around at nights."</p>
          <p id="p_001884" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_001884">George felt embarrassed. "I like to walk."</p>

          <p id="p_001886" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_001886">"Nothing much just right now. I'm waiting for a job." Since it shamed him to admit he wasn't working, George said, "I'm staying home--but I'm reading a lot to pick up my education."</p>

          <p id="p_001888" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_001888">Mr. Cattanzara looked interested. He mopped his hot face with a red handkerchief.</p>
          <p id="p_001889" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_001889">"What are you readin'?"</p>
          <p id="p_001890" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_001890">George hesitated, then said, "I got a list of books in the library once, and now I'm gonna read them this summer." He felt strange and a little unhappy saying this, but he wanted Mr. Cattanzara to respect him.</p>
          <p id="p_001891" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_001891">"How many books are there on it?"</p>
          <p id="p_001892" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_001892">"I never counted them. Maybe around a hundred."</p>
          <p id="p_001893" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_001893">Mr. Cattanzara whistled through his teeth.</p>
          <p id="p_001894" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_001894">"I figure if I did that," George went on earnestly, "it would help me in my education. I don't mean the kind they give you in high school. I want to know different things than they learn there, if you know what I mean."</p>
          <p id="p_001895" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_001895">The change maker nodded. "Still and all, one hundred books is a pretty big load for one summer."</p>
          <p id="p_001896" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_001896">"It might take longer."</p>
          <p id="p_001897" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_001897">"After you're finished with some, maybe you and I can shoot the breeze about them?" said Mr. Cattanzara.</p>
          <p id="p_001898" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_001898">"When I'm finished," George answered.</p>
          <p id="p_001899" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_001899">Mr. Cattanzara went home and George continued on his walk. After that, though he had the urge to, George did nothing different from usual. He still took his walks at night, ending up in the little park. But one evening the shoemaker on the next block stopped George to say he was a good boy, and George figured that Mr. Cattanzara had told him all about the books he was reading. From the shoemaker it must have gone down the street, because George saw a couple of people smiling kindly at him, though nobody spoke to him personally. He felt a little better around the neighborhood and liked it more, though not so much he would want to live in it forever. He had never exactly disliked the people in it, yet he had never liked them very much either. It was the fault of the neighborhood. To his surprise, George found out that his father and Sophie knew about his reading too. His father was too shy to say anything about it--he was never much of a talker in his whole life--but Sophie was softer to George, and she showed him in other ways she was proud of him.</p>
          <p id="p_001900" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_001900">As the summer went on George felt in a good mood about things. He cleaned the house every day, as a favor to Sophie, and he enjoyed the ball games more. Sophie gave him a buck a week allowance, and though it still wasn't enough and he had to use it carefully, it was a helluva lot better than just having two bits now and then. What he bought with the money--cigarettes mostly, an occasional beer or movie ticket--he got a big kick out of. Life wasn't so bad if you knew how to appreciate it. Occasionally he bought a paperback book from the newsstand, but he never got around to reading it, though he was glad to have a couple of books in his room. But he read thoroughly Sophie's magazines and newspapers. And at night was the most enjoyable time, because when he passed the storekeepers sitting outside their stores, he could tell they regarded him highly. He walked erect, and though he did not say much to them, or they to him, he could feel approval on all sides. A couple of nights he felt so good that he skipped the park at the end of the evening. He just wandered in the neighborhood, where people had known him from the time he was a kid playing punchball whenever there was a game of it going; he wandered there, then came home and got undressed for bed, feeling fine.</p>
          <p id="p_001901">
            <span class="text" id="span_001119" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#span_001119">For a few weeks he had talked only once with Mr. Cattanzara, and though the change maker</span>
            <pagenum id="p150" page="normal" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p150">150</pagenum>
            <span class="text" id="span_001120" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#span_001120">had said nothing more about the books, asked no questions, his silence made George a little uneasy. For a while George didn't pass in front of Mr. Cattanzara's house any more, until one night, forgetting himself, he approached it from a different direction than he usually did when he did. It was already past midnight. The street, except for one or two people, was deserted, and George was surprised when he saw Mr. Cattanzara still reading his newspaper by the light of the streetlamp overhead. His impulse was to stop at the stoop and talk to him. He wasn't sure what he wanted to say, though he felt the words would come when he began to talk; but the more he thought about it, the more the idea scared him, and he decided he'd better not. He even considered beating it home by another street, but he was too near Mr. Cattanzara, and the change maker might see him as he ran, and get annoyed. So George unobtrusively crossed the street, trying to make it seem as if he had to look in a store window on the other side, which he did, and then went on, uncomfortable at what he was doing. He feared Mr. Cattanzara would glance up from his paper and call him a dirty rat for walking on the other side of the street, but all he did was sit there, sweating through his undershirt, his bald head shining in the dim light as he read his</span>

            <span class="text" id="span_001121" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#span_001121">, and upstairs his fat wife leaned out of the window, seeming to read the paper along with him. George thought she would spy him and yell out to Mr. Cattanzara, but she never moved her eyes off her husband.</span>
          </p>
          <p id="p_001902" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_001902">George made up his mind to stay away from the change maker until he had got some of his softback books read, but when he started them and saw they were mostly storybooks, he lost his interest and didn't bother to finish them. He lost his interest in reading other things too. Sophie's magazines and newspapers went unread. She saw them piling up on a chair in his room and asked why he was no longer looking at them, and George told her it was because of all the other reading he had to do. Sophie said she had guessed that was it. So for most of the day, George had the radio on, turning to music when he was sick of the human voice. He kept the house fairly neat, and Sophie said nothing on the days when he neglected it. She was still kind and gave him his extra buck, though things weren't so good for him as they had been before.</p>
          <p id="p_001903" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_001903">But they were good enough, considering. Also his night walks invariably picked him up, no matter how bad the day was. Then one night George saw Mr. Cattanzara coming down the street toward him. George was about to turn and run but he recognized from Mr. Cattanzara's walk that he was drunk, and if so, probably he would not even bother to notice him. So George kept on walking straight ahead until he came abreast of Mr. Cattanzara and though he felt wound up enough to pop into the sky, he was not surprised when Mr. Cattanzara passed him without a word, walking slowly, his face and body stiff. George drew a breath in relief at his narrow escape, when he heard his name called, and there stood Mr. Cattanzara at his elbow, smelling like the inside of a beer barrel. His eyes were sad as he gazed at George, and George felt so intensely uncomfortable he was tempted to shove the drunk aside and continue on his walk.</p>
          <p id="p_001904" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_001904">But he couldn't act that way to him, and, besides, Mr. Cattanzara took a nickel out of his pants pocket and handed it to him.</p>
          <p id="p_001905" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_001905">"Go buy yourself a lemon ice, Georgie."</p>
          <p id="p_001906" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_001906">"It's not that time any more, Mr. Cattanzara," George said, "I am a big guy now."</p>
          <p id="p_001907" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_001907">"No, you ain't," said Mr. Cattanzara, to which George made no reply he could think of.</p>
          <p id="p_001908" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_001908">"How are all your books comin' along now?" Mr. Cattanzara asked. Though he tried to stand steady, he swayed a little.</p>
          <pagenum id="p151" page="normal" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p151">151</pagenum>
          <p id="p_001909" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_001909">"Fine, I guess," said George, feeling the red crawling up his face.</p>
          <p id="p_001910" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_001910">"You ain't sure?" The change maker smiled slyly, a way George had never seen him smile.</p>
          <p id="p_001911" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_001911">"Sure I'm sure. They're fine."</p>
          <p id="p_001912" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_001912">Though his head swayed in little arcs, Mr. Cattanzara's eyes were steady. He had small blue eyes which could hurt if you looked at them too long.</p>
          <p id="p_001913" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_001913">"George," he said, "name me one book on that list that you read this summer, and I will drink to your health."</p>
          <p id="p_001914" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_001914">"I don't want anybody drinking to me."</p>

          <p id="p_001916" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_001916">George knew he looked passable on the outside, but inside he was crumbling apart.</p>
          <p id="p_001917" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_001917">Unable to reply, he shut his eyes, but when-- years later--he opened them, he saw that Mr. Cattanzara had, out of pity, gone away, but in his ears he still heard the words he had said when he left: "George, don't do what I did."</p>
          <p id="p_001918" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_001918">The next night he was afraid to leave his room, and though Sophie argued with him he wouldn't open the door.</p>
          <p id="p_001919" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_001919">"What are you doing in there?" she asked.</p>

          <p id="p_001921" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_001921">"Aren't you reading?"</p>
          <p id="p_001922" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_001922">"No."</p>
          <p id="p_001923" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_001923">She was silent a minute, then asked, "Where do you keep the books you read? I never see any in your room outside of a few cheap trashy ones."</p>
          <p id="p_001924" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_001924">He wouldn't tell her.</p>
          <p id="p_001925" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_001925">"In that case you're not worth a buck of my hard-earned money. Why should I break my back for you? Go on out, you bum, and get ajob."</p>
          <p id="p_001926" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_001926">He stayed in his room for almost a week, except to sneak into the kitchen when nobody was home. Sophie railed at him, then begged him to come out, and his old father wept, but George wouldn't budge, though the weather was terrible and his small room stifling. He found it very hard to breathe, each breath was like drawing a flame into his lungs.</p>
          <p id="p_001927" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_001927">One night, unable to stand the heat anymore, he burst into the street at one a.m., a shadow of himself. He hoped to sneak to the park without being seen, but there were people all over the block, wilted and listless, waiting for a breeze. George lowered his eyes and walked, in disgrace, away from them, but before long he discovered they were still friendly to him. He figured Mr. Cattanzara hadn't told on him. Maybe when he woke up out of his drunk the next morning, he had forgotten all about meeting George. George felt his confidence slowly come back to him.</p>
          <p id="p_001928" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_001928">That same night a man on a street corner asked him if it was true that he had finished reading so many books, and George admitted he had. The man said it was a wonderful thing for a boy his age to read so much.</p>

There were books all over the place, wherever he looked, and though he was struggling to control an inward trembling, he easily counted off a hundred, then sat down at a table to read.</p>

          <p id="p_001966" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_001966">It was in the clove of seasons, summer was dead but autumn had not yet been born, that the ibis lit in the bleeding tree. The flower garden was stained with rotting brown magnolia petals and ironweeds grew rank amid the purple phlox. The five o'clocks by the chimney still marked time, but the oriole nest in the elm was untenanted and rocked back and forth like an empty cradle. The last graveyard flowers were blooming, and their smell drifted across the cotton field and through every room of our house, speaking softly the names of our dead. It's strange that all this is still so clear to me, now that that summer has long since fled and time has had its way. A grindstone stands where the bleeding tree stood, just outside the kitchen door, and now if an oriole sings in the elm, its song seems to die up in the leaves, a silvery dust. The flower garden is prim, the house a gleaming white, and the pale fence across the yard stands straight and spruce. But sometimes (like right now), as I sit in the cool, green-draped parlor, the grindstone begins to turn, and time with all its changes is ground away--and I remember Doodle.</p>
          <p id="p_001967" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_001967">Doodle was just about the craziest brother a boy ever had. Of course, he wasn't a crazy crazy like old Miss Leedie, who was in love with President Wilson and wrote him a letter every day, but was a nice crazy, like someone you meet in your dreams. He was born when I was six and was, from the outset, a disappointment. He seemed all head, with a tiny body which was red and shriveled like an old man's. Everybody thought he was going to die-- everybody except Aunt Nicey, who had delivered him. She said he would live because he was born in a caul and cauls were made from Jesus' nightgown. Daddy had Mr. Heath, the carpenter, build a little mahogany coffin for him. But he didn't die, and when he was three months old Mama and Daddy decided they might as well name him. They named him William Armstrong, which was like tying a big tail on a small kite. Such a name sounds good only on a tombstone.</p>

I wanted a brother. But Mama, crying, told me that even if William Armstrong lived, he would never do these things with me. He might not, she sobbed, even be "all there." He might, as long as he lived, lie on the rubber sheet in the center of the bed in the front bedroom, where the white marquisette</span>

          <p id="p_001972" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_001972">It was bad enough having an invalid brother, but having one who possibly was not all there was unbearable, so I began to make plans to kill him by smothering him with a pillow. However, one afternoon as I watched him, my head poked between the iron posts of the foot of the bed, he looked straight at me and grinned. I skipped through the rooms, down the echoing halls, shouting, "Mama, he smiled. He's all there! He's all there!" and he was.</p>
          <p id="p_001973" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_001973">When he was two, if you laid him on his stomach, he began to try to move himself, straining terribly. The doctor said that with his weak heart this strain would probably kill him, but it didn't. Trembling, he'd push himself up, turning first red, then a soft purple, and finally collapse back onto the bed like an old worn-out doll. I can still see Mama watching him, her hand pressed tight across her mouth, her eyes wide and unblinking. But he learned to crawl (it was his third winter), and we brought him out of the front bedroom, putting him on the rug before the fireplace. For the first time he became one of us.</p>
          <p id="p_001974" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_001974">As long as he lay all the time in bed, we called him William Armstrong, even though it was formal and sounded as if we were referring to one of our ancestors, but with his creeping around on the deerskin rug and beginning to talk, something had to be done about his name. It was I who renamed him. When he crawled, he crawled backward, as if he were in reverse and couldn't change gears. If you called him, he'd turn around as if he were going in the other direction, then he'd back right up to you to be picked up. Crawling backward made him look like a doodlebug, so I began to call him Doodle, and in time even Mama and Daddy thought it was a better name than William Armstrong. Only Aunt Nicey disagreed. She said caul babies should be treated with special respect since they might turn out to be saints. Renaming my brother was perhaps the kindest thing I ever did for him, because nobody expects much from someone called Doodle.</p>
          <p id="p_001975" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_001975">Although Doodle learned to crawl, he showed no signs of walking, but he wasn't idle. He talked so much that we all quit listening to what he said. It was about this time that Daddy built him a go-cart and I had to pull him around. At first I just paraded him up and down the piazza, but then he started crying to be taken out into the yard and it ended up by my having to lug him wherever I went. If I so much as picked up my cap, he'd start crying to go with me and Mama would call from wherever she was, "Take Doodle with you."</p>
          <p id="p_001976">
            <span class="text" id="span_001162" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#span_001162">He was a burden in many ways. The doctor had said that he mustn't get too excited, too hot, too cold, or too tired and that he must always be treated gently. A long list of don'ts went with him, all of which I ignored once we got out of the house. To discourage his coming with me, I'd run with him across the ends of the cotton rows and careen him around corners on two wheels. Sometimes I accidentally turned him over, but he never told Mama. His skin was very sensitive, and he had to wear a big straw hat whenever he went out. When the going got rough and he had to cling to the sides of the go-cart, the hat slipped all the way down over his ears. He was a sight. Finally, I</span>
            <pagenum id="p157" page="normal" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p157">157</pagenum>
            <span class="text" id="span_001163" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#span_001163">could see I was licked. Doodle was my brother and he was going to cling to me forever, no matter what I did, so I dragged him across the burning cotton field to share with him the only beauty I knew, Old Woman Swamp. I pulled the go-cart through the sawtooth fern, down into the green dimness where the palmetto fronds whispered by the stream. I lifted him out and set him down in the soft rubber grass beside a tall pine. His eyes were round with wonder as he gazed about him, and his little hands began to stroke the rubber grass. Then he began to cry.</span>

          <p id="p_001977" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_001977">"For heaven's sake, what's the matter?" I asked, annoyed.</p>
          <p id="p_001978" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_001978">"It's so pretty," he said. "So pretty, pretty, pretty."</p>
          <p id="p_001979" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_001979">After that day Doodle and I often went down into Old Woman Swamp. I would gather wildflowers, wild violets, honeysuckle, yellow jasmine, snakeflowers, and water lilies, and with wire grass we'd weave them into necklaces and crowns. We'd bedeck ourselves with our handiwork and loll about thus beautified, beyond the touch of the everyday world. Then when the slanted rays of the sun burned orange in the tops of the pines, we'd drop our jewels into the stream and watch them float away toward the sea.</p>

          <p id="p_001983" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_001983">"It is," I said. "And before I'll help you down from the loft, you're going to have to touch it."</p>
          <p id="p_001984" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_001984">"I won't touch it," he said sullenly.</p>
          <p id="p_001985" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_001985">"Then I'll leave you here by yourself," I threatened, and made as if I were going down.</p>
          <p id="p_001986" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_001986">Doodle was frightened of being left. "Don't go leave me, Brother," he cried, and he leaned toward the coffin. His hand, trembling, reached out, and when he touched the casket he screamed. A screech owl flapped out of the box into our faces, scaring us and covering us with Paris green. Doodle was paralyzed, so I put him on my shoulder and carried him down the ladder, and even when we were outside in the bright sunshine, he clung to me, crying, "Don't leave me. Don't leave me."</p>
          <p id="p_001987" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_001987">When Doodle was five years old, I was embarrassed at having a brother of that age who couldn't walk, so I set out to teach him. We were down in Old Woman Swamp and it was spring and the sick-sweet smell of bay flowers hung everywhere like a mournful song. "I'm going to teach you to walk, Doodle," I said.</p>
          <p id="p_001988" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_001988">He was sitting comfortably on the soft grass, leaning back against the pine. "Why?" he asked.</p>
          <p id="p_001989" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_001989">I hadn't expected such an answer. "So I won't have to haul you around all the time."</p>
          <p id="p_001990" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_001990">"I can't walk, Brother," he said.</p>
          <p id="p_001991" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_001991">"Who says so?" I demanded.</p>

          <p id="p_001993" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_001993">"Oh, you can walk," I said, and I took him by the arms and stood him up. He collapsed onto the grass like a half-empty flour sack. It was as if he had no bones in his little legs.</p>
          <p id="p_001994" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_001994">"Don't hurt me, Brother," he warned.</p>

But all of us must have something or someone to be proud of, and Doodle had become mine. I did not know then that pride is a wonderful, terrible thing, a seed that bears two vines, life and death. Every day that summer we went to the pine beside the stream of Old Woman Swamp, and I put him on his feet at least a hundred times each afternoon. Occasionally I too became discouraged because it didn't seem as if he was trying, and I would say, "Doodle, don't you</span>

          <p id="p_001999" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_001999">He'd nod his head, and I'd say, "Well, if you don't keep trying, you'll never learn." Then I'd paint for him a picture of us as old men, white-haired, him with a long white beard and me still pulling him around in the go-cart. This never failed to make him try again.</p>
          <p id="p_002000" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_002000">Finally one day, after many weeks of practicing, he stood alone for a few seconds. When he fell, I grabbed him in my arms and hugged him, our laughter pealing through the swamp like a ringing bell. Now we knew it could be done. Hope no longer hid in the dark palmetto thicket but perched like a cardinal in the lacy toothbrush tree, brilliantly visible. "Yes, yes," I cried, and he cried it too, and the grass beneath us was soft and the smell of the swamp was sweet.</p>
          <p id="p_002001" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_002001">With success so imminent, we decided not to tell anyone until he could actually walk. Each day, barring rain, we sneaked into Old Woman Swamp, and by cotton-picking time Doodle was ready to show what he could do. He still wasn't able to walk far, but we could wait no longer. Keeping a nice secret is very hard to do, like holding your breath. We chose to reveal all on October eighth, Doodle's sixth birthday, and for weeks ahead we mooned around the house, promising everybody a most spectacular surprise. Aunt Nicey said that, after so much talk, if we produced anything less tremendous than the Resurrection, she was going to be disappointed.</p>

            <span class="text" id="span_001172" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#span_001172">At breakfast on our chosen day, when Mama, Daddy, and Aunt Nicey were in the dining room, I brought Doodle to the door in the go-cart just as usual and had them turn their backs, making them cross their hearts and hope to die if they peeked. I helped Doodle up, and when he was standing alone I let them look. There wasn't a sound as Doodle walked slowly across the room and sat down at his place at the table. Then Mama began to cry and ran over to him, hugging him and kissing him. Daddy hugged him too, so I went to Aunt Nicey, who was thanks-praying in the doorway, and began to waltz her around. We danced together quite well until she came down on my big toe with her brogans,</span>

People in his stories all had wings and flew wherever they wanted to go. His favorite lie was about a boy named Peter who had a pet peacock with a ten-foot tail. Peter wore a golden robe that glittered so brightly that when he walked through the sunflowers they turned away from the sun to face him. When Peter was ready to go to sleep, the peacock spread his magnificent tail, enfolding the boy gently like a closing go-to-sleep flower, burying him in the gloriously iridescent,</span>

          <p id="p_002010" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_002010">Doodle and I spent lots of time thinking about our future. We decided that when we were grown we'd live in Old Woman Swamp and pick dog-tongue for a living. Beside the stream, he planned, we'd build us a house of whispering leaves and the swamp birds would be our chickens. All day long (when we weren't gathering dog-tongue) we'd swing through the cypresses on the rope vines, and if it rained we'd huddle beneath an umbrella tree and play stickfrog. Mama and Daddy could come and live with us if they wanted to. He even came up with the idea that he could marry Mama and I could marry Daddy. Of course, I was old enough to know this wouldn't work out, but the picture he painted was so beautiful and serene that all I could do was whisper Yes, yes.</p>
          <p id="p_002011" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_002011">Once I had succeeded in teaching Doodle to walk, I began to believe in my own infallibility and I prepared a terrific development program for him, unknown to Mama and Daddy, of course. I would teach him to run, to swim, to climb trees, and to fight. He, too, now believed in my infallibility, so we set the deadline for these accomplishments less than a year away, when, it had been decided, Doodle could start to school.</p>
          <p id="p_002012" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_002012">That winter we didn't make much progress, for I was in school and Doodle suffered from one bad cold after another. But when spring came, rich and warm, we raised our sights again. Success lay at the end of summer like a pot of gold, and our campaign got off to a good start. On hot days, Doodle and I went down to Horsehead Landing and I gave him swimming lessons or showed him how to row a boat. Sometimes we descended into the cool greenness of Old Woman Swamp and climbed the rope vines or boxed scientifically beneath the pine where he had learned to walk. Promise hung about us like the leaves, and wherever we looked, ferns unfurled and birds broke into song.</p>

            <span class="text" id="span_001185" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#span_001185">That summer, the summer of 1918, was blighted. In May and June there was no rain and the crops withered, curled up, then died under the thirsty sun. One morning in July a hurricane came out of the east, tipping over the oaks in the yard and splitting the limbs of the elm trees. That afternoon it roared back out of the west, blew the fallen oaks around, snapping their roots and tearing them out of the earth like a hawk at the entrails of a chicken. Cotton bolls were wrenched from the stalks and lay like green walnuts in the valleys between the rows, while the cornfield leaned over uniformly so that the tassels touched the ground. Doodle and I followed Daddy out into the cotton field, where he stood, shoulders sagging, surveying the ruin. When his chin sank down onto his chest, we were frightened, and Doodle slipped his hand into mine. Suddenly Daddy straightened his shoulders, raised a giant knuckly fist, and with a voice that seemed</span>

          <p id="p_002016" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_002016">So we came to that clove of seasons. School was only a few weeks away, and Doodle was far behind schedule. He could barely clear the ground when climbing up the rope vines and his swimming was certainly not passable. We decided to double our efforts, to make that last drive and reach our pot of gold. I made him swim until he turned blue and row until he couldn't lift an oar. Wherever we went, I purposely walked fast, and although he kept up, his face turned red and his eyes became glazed. Once, he could go no further, so he collapsed on the ground and began to cry.</p>
          <p id="p_002017" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_002017">"Aw, come on, Doodle," I urged. "You can do it. Do you want to be different from everybody else when you start school?"</p>
          <p id="p_002018" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_002018">"Does it make any difference?"</p>
          <p id="p_002019" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_002019">"It certainly does," I said. "Now, come on," and I helped him up.</p>
          <p id="p_002020" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_002020">As we slipped through dog days, Doodle began to look feverish, and Mama felt his forehead, asking him if he felt ill. At night he didn't sleep well, and sometimes he had nightmares, crying out until I touched him and said, "Wake up, Doodle. Wake up."</p>
          <p id="p_002021" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_002021">It was Saturday noon, just a few days before school was to start. I should have already admitted defeat, but my pride wouldn't let me. The excitement of our program had now been gone for weeks, but still we kept on with a tired doggedness. It was too late to turn back, for we had both wandered too far into a net of expectations and had left no crumbs behind.</p>
          <p id="p_002022" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_002022">Daddy, Mama, Doodle, and I were seated at the dining-room table having lunch. It was a hot day, with all the windows and doors open in case a breeze should come. In the kitchen Aunt Nicey was humming softly. After a long silence, Daddy spoke. "It's so calm, I wouldn't be surprised if we had a storm this afternoon."</p>
          <p id="p_002023" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_002023">"I haven't heard a rain frog," said Mama, who believed in signs, as she served the bread around the table.</p>
          <p id="p_002024" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_002024">"I did," declared Doodle. "Down in the swamp."</p>
          <p id="p_002025" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_002025">"He didn't," I said contrarily.</p>
          <p id="p_002026" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_002026">"You did, eh?" said Daddy, ignoring my denial.</p>
          <p id="p_002027" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_002027">"I certainly did," Doodle reiterated, scowling at me over the top of his iced-tea glass, and we were quiet again.</p>
          <p id="p_002028" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_002028">Suddenly, from out in the yard, came a strange croaking noise. Doodle stopped eating, with a piece of bread poised ready for his mouth, his eyes popped round like two blue buttons. "What's that?" he whispered.</p>
          <p id="p_002029" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_002029">I jumped up, knocking over my chair, and had reached the door when Mama called, "Pick up the chair, sit down again, and say excuse me."</p>
          <p id="p_002030" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_002030">By the time I had done this, Doodle had excused himself and had slipped out into the yard. He was looking up into the bleeding tree. "It's a great big red bird!" he called.</p>
          <p id="p_002031">
            <span class="text" id="span_001193" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#span_001193">The bird croaked loudly again, and Mama and Daddy came out into the yard. We shaded our eyes with our hands against the hazy glare of the sun and peered up through the still leaves. On the topmost branch a bird the size of a chicken, with scarlet feathers and long legs, was perched precariously. Its wings hung</span>
            <pagenum id="p161" page="normal" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p161">161</pagenum>
            <span class="text" id="span_001194" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#span_001194">down loosely, and as we watched, a feather dropped away and floated slowly down through the green leaves.</span>

          <p id="p_002033" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_002033">"It's not even frightened of us," Mama said.</p>
          <p id="p_002034" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_002034">"It looks tired," Daddy added. "Or maybe sick."</p>
          <p id="p_002035" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_002035">Doodle's hands were clasped at his throat, and I had never seen him stand still so long. "What is it?" he asked.</p>
          <p id="p_002036" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_002036">Daddy shook his head. "I don't know, maybe it's----"</p>
          <p id="p_002037" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_002037">At that moment the bird began to flutter, but the wings were uncoordinated, and amid much flapping and a spray of flying feathers, it tumbled down, bumping through the limbs of the bleeding tree and landing at our feet with a thud. Its long, graceful neck jerked twice into an S, then straightened out, and the bird was still. A white veil came over the eyes and the long white beak unhinged. Its legs were crossed and its clawlike feet were delicately curved at rest. Even death did not mar its grace, for it lay on the earth like a broken vase of red flowers, and we stood around it, awed by its exotic beauty.</p>
          <p id="p_002038" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_002038">"It's dead," Mama said.</p>
          <p id="p_002039" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_002039">"What is it?" Doodle repeated.</p>
          <p id="p_002040" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_002040">"Go bring me the bird book," said Daddy.</p>
          <p id="p_002041" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_002041">I ran into the house and brought back the bird book. As we watched, Daddy thumbed through its pages. "It's a scarlet ibis," he said, pointing to a picture. "It lives in the tropics- South America to Florida. A storm must have brought it here."</p>

          <p id="p_002043" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_002043">"Let's finish lunch," Mama said, nudging us back toward the dining room.</p>
          <p id="p_002044" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_002044">"I'm not hungry," said Doodle, and he knelt down beside the ibis.</p>
          <p id="p_002045" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_002045">"We've got peach cobbler for dessert," Mama tempted from the doorway.</p>
          <p id="p_002046" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_002046">Doodle remained kneeling. "I'm going to bury him."</p>
          <p id="p_002047" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_002047">"Don't you dare touch him," Mama warned. "There's no telling what disease he might have had."</p>
          <p id="p_002048" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_002048">"All right," said Doodle. "I won't."</p>
          <p id="p_002049" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_002049">Daddy, Mama, and I went back to the dining- room table, but we watched Doodle through the open door. He took out a piece of string from his pocket and, without touching this ibis, looped one end around its neck. Slowly, while singing softly "Shall We Gather at the River," he carried the bird around to the front yard and dug a hole in the flower garden, next to the petunia bed. Now we were watching him through the front window, but he didn't know it. His awkwardness at digging the hole with a shovel whose handle was twice as long as he was made us laugh, and we covered our mouths with our hands so he wouldn't hear.</p>
          <pagenum id="p162" page="normal" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p162">162</pagenum>
          <p id="p_002050" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_002050">When Doodle came into the dining room, he found us seriously eating our cobbler. He was pale and lingered just inside the screen door. "Did you get the scarlet ibis buried?" asked Daddy.</p>
          <p id="p_002051" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_002051">Doodle didn't speak but nodded his head.</p>
          <p id="p_002052" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_002052">"Go wash your hands, and then you can have some peach cobbler," said Mama.</p>
          <p id="p_002053" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_002053">"I'm not hungry," he said.</p>

            <span class="text" id="span_001197" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#span_001197">"Dead birds is bad luck," said Aunt Nicey, poking her head from the kitchen door. "Specially</span>

          <p id="p_002055" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_002055">As soon as I had finished eating, Doodle and I hurried off to Horsehead Landing. Time was short, and Doodle still had a long way to go if he was going to keep up with the other boys when he started school. The sun, gilded with the yellow cast of autumn, still burned fiercely, but the dark green woods through which we passed were shady and cool. When we reached the landing, Doodle said he was too tired to swim, so we got into a skiff and floated down the creek with the tide. Far off in the marsh a rail was scolding, and over on the beach locusts were singing in the myrtle trees. Doodle did not speak and kept his head turned away, letting one hand trail limply in the water.</p>
          <p id="p_002056" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_002056">After we had drifted a long way, I put the oars in place and made Doodle row back against the tide. Black clouds began to gather in the southwest, and he kept watching them, trying to pull the oars a little faster. When we reached Horsehead Landing, lightning was playing across half the sky and thunder roared out, hiding even the sound of the sea. The sun disappeared and darkness descended, almost like night. Flocks of marsh crows flew by, heading inland to their roosting trees, and two egrets, squawking, arose from the oyster-rock shallows and careened away.</p>
          <p id="p_002057" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00007.smil#p_002057">Doodle was both tired and frightened, and when he stepped from the skiff he collapsed onto the mud, sending an armada of fiddler crabs rustling off into the marsh grass. I helped him up, and as he wiped the mud off his trousers, he smiled at me ashamedly. He had failed and we both knew it, so we started back home, racing the storm. We never spoke (What are the words that can solder cracked pride?), but I knew he was watching me, watching for a sign of mercy. The lightning was near now, and from fear he walked so close behind me he kept stepping on my heels. The faster I walked, the faster he walked, so I began to run. The rain was coming, roaring through the pines, and then, like a bursting Roman candle, a gum tree ahead of us was shattered by a bolt of lightning. When the deafening peal of thunder had died, and in the moment before the rain arrived, I heard Doodle, who had fallen behind, cry out, "Brother, Brother, don't leave me! Don't leave me!"</p>

I ran as fast as I could, leaving him far behind with a wall of rain dividing us. The drops stung my face like nettles, and the wind flared the wet, glistening leaves of the bordering trees. Soon I could hear his voice no more.</p>

The sound of rain was everywhere, but the wind had died and it fell straight down in parallel paths like ropes hanging from the sky. As I waited, I peered through the downpour, but no one came. Finally I went back and found him huddled beneath a red nightshade bush beside the road. He was sitting on the ground, his face buried in his arms, which were resting on his drawn-up knees.

She stood by the window and looked out dully at a gray cat walking a gray fence in a gray backyard. Tomorrow would be Christmas Day, and she had only one dollar and eighty-seven cents with which to buy Jim a present. She had been saving every penny she could for months, with this result. Twenty dollars a week doesn't go far. Expenses had been greater than she had calculated. They always are. Only one dollar and eighty-seven cents to buy a present for Jim. Her Jim. Many a happy hour she had spent planning for something nice for him. Something fine and rare and sterling--something just a little bit near to being worthy of the honor of being owned by Jim.</p>

Beautiful combs, pure tortoise shell, with jeweled rims--just the shade to wear in the beautiful vanished hair. They were expensive combs, she knew, and her heart had simply craved and yearned over them without the least hope of possession. And now they were hers, but the tresses that should have adorned the coveted adornments were gone.</p>

They invented the art of giving Christmas presents. Being wise, their gifts were no doubt wise ones, possibly bearing the privilege of exchange in case of duplication. And here I have lamely related to you the uneventful chronicle of two foolish children in a flat who most unwisely sacrificed for each other the greatest treasures of their house. But in a last word to the wise of these days let it be said that of all who give gifts these two were the wisest. Of all who give and receive gifts, such as they are wisest. Everywhere they are wisest. They are the Magi.</p>

Henry makes an allusion to the Biblical story of Solomon and Sheba. Locate this allusion and tell how it is important to the plot and theme.</p>

The son of a doctor, he grew up in Greensboro, North Carolina. When he was twenty, he moved to Texas for reasons of health. He settled in Austin, where he worked as a clerk, bookkeeper, and bank teller. To earn more money, he began contributing news items and sketches to newspapers throughout the country, and in 1895, he moved to Houston to work as a reporter for the Houston</span>

Porter was almost certainly innocent of the charge. The bank he had worked for was notoriously lax in its accounting procedures, and Porter himself had probably been no more than careless. He boarded a train to Austin, but on impulse he went to New Orleans instead, and then to Honduras in Central America. Three years later, the news that his wife was seriously ill brought him back to Texas. He stood trial, was convicted, and served five years in prison.</span>

His editors encouraged him to move to New York. It was in New York that Porter adopted the pen name of O. Henry and became a famous writer of short stories. He was a prolific writer. In 1905 alone he wrote sixty-five short stories. In his stories, he drew on his experiences out West and in Latin America. Above all, he drew on his knowledge of and fascination with New York, whose streets he roamed in search of ideas. He called New York "Baghdad-on-the-Subway," comparing it to the fabulous city of Scheherazade's</span>

          <p id="p_002299" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00008.smil#p_002299">Where my grandfather came from, most of the people lived by working in the flax sheds. For five generations they had been breathing in the dust which rose from the crushed flax stalks, letting themselves be killed off by slow degrees, a race of long-suffering, cheerful people who ate goat cheese, potatoes, and now and then a rabbit; in the evening they would sit at home spinning and knitting; they sang, drank mint tea and were happy. During the day they would carry the flax stalks to the antiquated machines, with no protection from the dust and at the mercy of the heat which came pouring out of the drying kilns. Each cottage contained only one bed, standing against the wall like a closet and reserved for the parents, while the children slept all round the room on benches. In the morning the room would be filled with the odor of thin soup; on Sundays there was stew, and on feast days the children's faces would light up with pleasure as they watched the black acorn coffee turning paler and paler from the milk their smiling mother poured into their coffee mugs.</p>
          <p id="p_002300" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00008.smil#p_002300">The parents went off early to the flax sheds; the housework was left to the children: they would sweep the room, tidy up, wash the dishes and peel the potatoes, precious pale-yellow fruit whose thin peel had to be produced afterwards to dispel any suspicion of extravagance or carelessness.</p>

          <p id="p_002305" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00008.smil#p_002305">The woods belonged to the Baleks, as well as the flax sheds, and in my grandfather's village the Baleks had a chÃ¢teau, and the wife of the head of the family had a little room next to the dairy where mushrooms, herbs and hay flowers were weighed and paid for. There on the table stood the great Balek scales, an old-fashioned, ornate bronze-gilt contraption, which my grandfather's grandparents had already faced when they were children, their grubby hands holding their little baskets of mushrooms, their paper bags of hayflowers, breathlessly watching the number of weights Frau Balek had to throw on the scale before the swinging pointer came to rest exactly over the black line, that thin line of justice which had to be redrawn every year. Then Frau Balek would take the big book covered in brown leather, write down the weight, and pay out the money, pfennigs or ten-pfennigs or ten-pfennig pieces and very, very occasionally, a mark. And when my grandfather was a child there was a big glass jar of lemon drops standing there, the kind that cost one mark a kilo, and when Frau Balek--whichever one happened to be presiding over the little room-was in a good mood, she would put her hand into this jar and give each child a lemon drop, and the children's faces would light up with pleasure, the way they used to when on feast days their mother poured milk into their coffee mugs, milk that made the coffee turn paler and paler until it was as pale as the flaxen pigtails of the little girls.</p>

            <span class="text" id="span_001418" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00008.smil#span_001418">One of the laws imposed by the Baleks on the village was: No one was permitted to have any scales in the house. The law was so ancient that nobody gave a thought as to when and how it had arisen, and it had to be obeyed, for anyone who broke it was dismissed from the flax sheds, he could not sell his mushrooms or his thyme or his hayflowers, and the power of the Baleks was so far-reaching that no one in the neighboring villages would give him work either, or buy his forest herbs. But since the days when my grandfather's parents had gone out as small children to gather mushrooms and sell them in order that they might season the meat of the rich people of Prague</span>

          <p id="p_002310" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00008.smil#p_002310">My grandfather was hardworking and smart: he crawled further into the woods than the children of his clan had crawled before him, he penetrated as far as the thicket where, according to legend, Bilgan the Giant was supposed to dwell, guarding a treasure. But my grandfather was not afraid of Bilgan: he worked his way deep into the thicket, even when he was quite little, and brought out great quantities of mushrooms; he even found truffles, for which Frau Balek paid thirty pfennigs a pound. Everything my grandfather took to the Baleks he entered on the back of a torn-off calendar page: every pound of mushrooms, every gram of thyme, and on the right-hand side, in his childish handwriting, he entered the amount he received for each item; he scrawled in every pfennig, from the age of seven to the age of twelve, and by the time he was twelve the year 1900 had arrived, and because the Baleks had been raised to the aristocracy by the Emperor, they gave every family in the village a quarter of a pound of real coffee, the Brazilian kind; there was also free beer and tobacco for the men, and at the chÃ¢teau there was a great banquet; many carriages stood in the avenue of poplars leading from the entrance gates to the chÃ¢teau.</p>
          <p id="p_002311" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00008.smil#p_002311">But the day before the banquet the coffee was distributed in the little room which had housed the Balek scales for almost a hundred years, and the Balek family was now called Balek von Bilgan because, according to legend, Bilgan the Giant used to have a great castle on the site of the present Balek estate.</p>
          <p id="p_002312" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00008.smil#p_002312">My grandfather often used to tell me how he went there after school to fetch the coffee for four families: the Cechs, the Weidlers, the Vohlas and his own, the BrÃ¼chers. It was the afternoon of New Year's Eve: there were the front rooms to be decorated, the baking to be done, and the families did not want to spare four boys and have each of them go all the way to the chÃ¢teau to bring back a quarter of a pound of coffee.</p>
          <p id="p_002313" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00008.smil#p_002313">And so my grandfather sat on the narrow wooden bench in the little room while Gertrud the maid counted out the wrapped four-ounce packages of coffee, four of them, and he looked at the scales and saw that the pound weight was still lying on the left-hand scale; Frau Balek von Bilgan was busy with preparations for the banquet. And when Gertrud was about to put her hand into the jar with the lemon drops to give my grandfather one, she discovered it was empty: it was refilled once a year, and held one kilo of the kind that cost a mark.</p>
          <p id="p_002314">
            <span class="text" id="span_001426" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00008.smil#span_001426">Gertrud laughed and said: "Wait here while I get the new lot," and my grandfather waited with the four four-ounce packages which had been wrapped and sealed in the factory, facing the scales on which someone had left the pound weight, and my grandfather took the four packages of coffee, put them on the empty scale, and his heart thudded as he watched the black finger of justice come to rest on the left of the black line: the scale with the pound weight stayed down, and the pound of coffee remained up in the air; his heart thudded more than if he had been lying behind a bush in the forest waiting for Bilgan the Giant, and he felt in his pocket for the pebbles he always carried with him so he could use his catapult to shoot the sparrows which pecked away at his mother's cabbage plants--he had to put three, four, five pebbles beside the packages of coffee before the scale with the pound weight rose and the pointer at last came to rest over the black line. My grandfather took the coffee from the scale, wrapped the five pebbles in his kerchief, and when Gertrud came back with the big kilo bag of lemon drops which had to last for another whole year in order to make the children's faces light up with pleasure, when Gertrud let the lemon drops rattle into</span>

My grandfather only took three of the packages, then Gertrud looked in startled surprise at the white-faced child who threw the lemon drop onto the floor, ground it under his heel, and said: "I want to see Frau Balek."</span>
          </p>
          <p id="p_002315" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00008.smil#p_002315">"Balek von Bilgan, if you please," said Gertrud.</p>
          <p id="p_002316" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00008.smil#p_002316">"All right, Frau Balek von Bilgan," but Gertrud only laughed at him, and he walked back to the village in the dark, took the Cechs, the Weidlers and the Vohlas their coffee, and said he had to go and see the priest.</p>
          <p id="p_002317" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00008.smil#p_002317">Instead he went out into the dark night with his five pebbles in his kerchief. He had to walk a long way before he found someone who had scales, who was permitted to have them; no one in the villages of Blaugau and Bernau had any, he knew that, and he went straight through them till, after two hours' walking, he reached the little town of Dielheim where Honig the apothecary lived. From Honig's house came the smell of fresh pancakes, and Honig's breath, when he opened the door to the half-frozen boy, already smelled of punch, there was a moist cigar between his narrow lips, and he clasped the boy's cold hands firmly for a moment, saying: "What's the matter, has your father's lung got worse?"</p>
          <p id="p_002318" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00008.smil#p_002318">"No, I haven't come for medicine, I wanted ..." My grandfather undid his kerchief, took out the five pebbles, held them out to Honig and said: "I wanted to have these weighed." He glanced anxiously into Honig's face, but when Honig said nothing and did not get angry, or even ask him anything, my grandfather said: "It is the amount that is short of justice," and now, as he went into the warm room, my grandfather realized how wet his feet were. The snow had soaked through his cheap shoes, and in the forest the branches had showered him with snow which was now melting, and he was tired and hungry and suddenly began to cry because he thought of the quantities of mushrooms, the herbs, the flowers, which had been weighed on the scales which were short five pebbles' worth of justice. And when Honig, shaking his head and holding the five pebbles, called his wife, my grandfather thought of the generations of his parents, his grandparents, who had all had to have their mushrooms, their flowers, weighed on the scales, and he was overwhelmed by a great wave of injustice, and began to sob louder than ever, and, without waiting to be asked, he sat down on a chair, ignoring the pancakes, the cup of hot coffee which nice plump Frau Honig put in front of him, and did not stop crying till Honig himself came out from the shop at the back and, rattling the pebbles in his hand, said in a low voice to his wife: "Fifty-five grams, exactly."</p>
          <p id="p_002319" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00008.smil#p_002319">My grandfather walked the two hours home through the forest, got a beating at home, said nothing, not a single word, when he was asked about the coffee, spent the whole evening doing sums on the piece of paper on which he had written down everything he had sold to Frau Balek, and when midnight struck, and the cannon could be heard from the chÃ¢teau, and the whole village rang with shouting and laughter and the noise of rattles, when the family kissed and embraced all round, he said into the New Year silence: "The Baleks owe me eighteen marks and thirty-two pfennigs." And again he thought of all the children there were in the village, of his brother Fritz who had gathered so many mushrooms, of his sister Ludmilla; he thought of the many hundreds of children who had all gathered mushrooms for the Baleks, and herbs and flowers, and this time he did not cry but told his parents and brothers and sisters of his discovery.</p>

They had expected garlands in the village, a song in their honor, cheers and hurrahs, but the village was completely deserted as they drove through it, and in church the pale faces of the people were turned toward them, mute and hostile, and when the priest mounted the pulpit to deliver his New Year's sermon he sensed the chill in those otherwise quiet and peaceful faces, and he stumbled painfully through his sermon and went back to the altar drenched in sweat. And as the Baleks von Bilgan left the church after Mass, they walked through a lane of mute, pale faces. But young Frau Balek von Bilgan stopped in front of the children's pews, sought out my grandfather's face, pale little Franz BrÃ¼cher, and asked him, right there in the church: "Why didn't you take the coffee for your mother?" And my grandfather stood up and said: "Because you owe me as much money as five kilos of coffee would cost." And</span>

But a great many gendarmes appeared, and the men and women were threatened with prison, and the Baleks forced the priest to display the scales publicly in the school and demonstrate that the finger of justice swung to and fro accurately. And the men and women went back to the flax sheds--but no one went to the school to watch the priest: he stood there all alone, helpless and forlorn with his weights, scales, and packages of coffee.</p>

He served in the German army during World War II, mostly on the Russian front, and was wounded four times. After his release from a prisoner-of-war-camp in 1945, he returned to Cologne. There he found a job with the city government and began to write. In his novels and short stories, BÃ¶ll probed the nature of German society.</span>

            <p id="p_002377" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00008.smil#p_002377">In 1972 BÃ¶ll was awarded the Nobel prize for Liternature for his contributions "to a renewal of German literature." Critics have noted a strong vein of ironic humor that runs through his basically serious work. One German critic has called him "Germany's best as well as best-selling author whose work is both profound and eminently readable."</p>

          <p id="p_002422" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00008.smil#p_002422">The next day she paid her friend a visit and told her of her predicament.</p>
          <p id="p_002423" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00008.smil#p_002423">Mme. Forestier went toward a large closet with mirrored doors, took out a large jewel box, brought it over, opened it, and said to Mme. Loisel: "Pick something out, my dear."</p>
          <p id="p_002424" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00008.smil#p_002424">At first her eyes noted some bracelets, then a pearl necklace, then a Venetian cross, gold and gems, of marvelous workmanship. She tried on these adornments in front of the mirror, but hesitated, unable to decide which to part with and put back. She kept on asking, "Haven't you something else?"</p>
          <p id="p_002425" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00008.smil#p_002425">"Oh, yes, keep on looking. I don't know just what you'd like."</p>
          <p id="p_002426" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00008.smil#p_002426">All at once she found, in a black satin box, a superb diamond necklace; and her pulse beat faster with longing. Her hands trembled as she took it up. Clasping it around her throat, outside her high-necked dress, she stood in ecstasy looking at her reflection.</p>
          <p id="p_002427" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00008.smil#p_002427">Then she asked, hesitatingly, pleading, "Could I borrow that, just that and nothing else?"</p>
          <p id="p_002428" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00008.smil#p_002428">"Why, of course."</p>
          <p id="p_002429" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00008.smil#p_002429">She threw her arms around her friend, kissed her warmly, and fled with her treasure.</p>
          <p id="p_002430" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00008.smil#p_002430">The day of the party arrived. Mme. Loisel was a sensation. She was the prettiest one there, fashionable, gracious, smiling, and wild with joy. All the men turned to look at her, asked who she was, begged to be introduced. All the Cabinet officials wanted to waltz with her. The minister took notice of her.</p>
          <p id="p_002431" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00008.smil#p_002431">She danced madly, wildly, drunk with pleasure, giving no thought to anything in the triumph of her beauty, the pride of her success, in a kind of happy cloud composed of all the adulation, of all the admiring glances, of all the awakened longings, of a sense of complete victory that is so sweet to a woman's heart.</p>
          <p id="p_002432" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00008.smil#p_002432">She left around four o'clock in the morning. Her husband, since midnight, had been dozing in a small empty sitting room with three other gentlemen whose wives were having too good a time.</p>
          <p id="p_002433" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00008.smil#p_002433">He threw over her shoulders the wraps he had brought for going home, modest garments of everyday life whose shabbiness clashed with the stylishness of her evening clothes. She felt this and longed to escape, unseen by the other women who were draped in expensive furs.</p>
          <p id="p_002434" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00008.smil#p_002434">Loisel held her back.</p>

            <p id="p_002513" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00009.smil#p_002513">The theme of "The Necklace" depends upon a contrast between true values and false values. Nowhere is the contrast directly stated, nor is the author's attitude toward Madame Loisel specifically declared. Yet readers can perceive this attitude as they learn more about Madame and Monsieur Loisel. For example, Madame Loisel's desire for an expensive evening dress shows that she values appearances and does not consider how such an extravagance will strain her husband's finances. Details such as this not only characterize Madame Loisel but also shape readers' attitudes toward her and her values.</p>

After he served in the French army during the Franco-Prussian War, he went to Paris and got a job as a government clerk. An aspiring writer, he made friends with a number of distinguished French writers, among them Gustave Flaubert. Maupassant became Flaubert's protÃ©gÃ© and showed the older man many manuscripts before Flaubert decided that his young disciple was ready to publish. Maupassant's first published story, "Ball of Fat," was acclaimed a masterpiece. By 1882, he had achieved success as a writer and was able to quit his government post. He wrote prolifically, producing sixteen volumes of short stories, six novels, and several volumes of travel sketches. It is for his short stories that Maupassant is principally remembered. They are famous for their clear, smooth style, their compression, and their eye for telling detail. His stories reflect his knowledge of country life and small-town life in Normandy, and of fashionable and unfashionable life in Paris, Among his best-known stories are "The Piece of String," "The Duel," "At Sea," "Two Little Soldiers," and "The Diary of a Madman." Maupassant's most famous story is "The Necklace"; it is one of the most frequently anthologized stories of all time.</span>

His course included both theory and practice. In the morning there were long lectures on the history, anatomy, manners and customs of dragons. Gawaine did not distinguish himself in these studies. He had a marvelously versatile gift for forgetting things. In the afternoon he showed to better advantage, for then he would go down to the South Meadow and practice with a battle-ax. In this exercise he was truly impressive, for he had enormous strength as well as speed and grace. He even developed a deceptive display of ferocity. Old alumni say that it was a thrilling sight to see Gawaine charging across the field toward the dummy paper dragon which had been set up for his practice.

          <p id="p_002551" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00009.smil#p_002551">Gawaine hesitated.</p>
          <p id="p_002552" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00009.smil#p_002552">"Oh, I know it's against the rules," said the Headmaster. "But after all, you have received your preliminary degree. You are no longer a boy. You are a man. Tomorrow you will go out into the world, the great world of achievement."</p>
          <p id="p_002553" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00009.smil#p_002553">Gawaine took a cigarette. The Headmaster offered him a match, but he produced one of his own and began to puff away with a dexterity which quite amazed the principal.</p>
          <p id="p_002554" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00009.smil#p_002554">"Here you have learned the theories of life," continued the Headmaster, resuming the thread of his discourse, "but after all, life is not a matter of theories. Life is a matter of facts. It calls on the young and the old alike to face these facts, even though they are hard and sometimes unpleasant. Your problem, for example, is to slay dragons."</p>
          <p id="p_002555" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00009.smil#p_002555">"They say that those dragons down in the south wood are five hundred feet long," ventured Gawaine, timorously.</p>
          <p id="p_002556" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00009.smil#p_002556">"Stuff and nonsense!" said the Headmaster. "The curate saw one last week from the top of Arthur's Hill. The dragon was sunning himself down in the valley. The curate didn't have an opportunity to look at him very long because he felt it was his duty to hurry back to make a report to me. He said the monster--or shall I say, the big lizard?--wasn't an inch over two hundred feet. But the size has nothing at all to do with it. You'll find the big ones even easier than the little ones. They're far slower on their feet and less aggressive, I'm told. Besides, before you go I'm going to equip you in such fashion that you need have no fear of all the dragons in the world."</p>
          <p id="p_002557" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00009.smil#p_002557">"I'd like an enchanted cap," said Gawaine.</p>
          <p id="p_002558" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00009.smil#p_002558">"What's that?" asked the Headmaster, testily.</p>
          <p id="p_002559" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00009.smil#p_002559">"A cap to make me disappear," explained Gawaine.</p>
          <p id="p_002560" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00009.smil#p_002560">The Headmaster laughed indulgently. "You mustn't believe all those old wives' stories," he said. "There isn't any such thing. A cap to make you disappear, indeed! What would you do with it? You haven't even appeared yet. Why, my boy, you could walk from here to London, and nobody would so much as look at you. You're nobody. You couldn't be more invisible than that."</p>
          <p id="p_002561" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00009.smil#p_002561">Gawaine seemed dangerously close to a relapse into his old habit of whimpering. The Headmaster reassured him: "Don't worry; I'll give you something much better than an enchanted cap. I'm going to give you a magic word. All you have to do is to repeat this magic charm once and no dragon can possibly harm a hair of your head. You can cut off his head at your leisure."</p>
          <p id="p_002562" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00009.smil#p_002562">He took a heavy book from the shelf behind his desk and began to run through it. "Sometimes," he said, "the charm is a whole phrase or even a sentence. I might, for instance, give you 'To make the'--no, that might not do. I think a single word would be best for dragons."</p>
          <p id="p_002563" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00009.smil#p_002563">"A short word," suggested Gawaine.</p>
          <p id="p_002564" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00009.smil#p_002564">"It can't be too short or it wouldn't be potent. There isn't so much hurry as all that. Here's a splendid magic word: 'Rumplesnitz.' Do you think you can learn that?"</p>
          <p id="p_002565">
            <span class="text" id="span_001559" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00009.smil#span_001559">Gawaine tried and in an hour or so he seemed to have the word well in hand. Again and again he interrupted the lesson to inquire,</span>

            <span class="text" id="span_001560" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00009.smil#span_001560">"And if I say 'Rumplesnitz' the dragon can't possibly hurt me?" And always the Headmaster replied, "If you only say 'Rumplesnitz,' you are perfectly safe."</span>
          </p>
          <p id="p_002566" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00009.smil#p_002566">Toward morning Gawaine seemed resigned to his career. At daybreak the Headmaster saw him to the edge of the forest and pointed him to the direction in which he should proceed. About a mile away to the southwest a cloud of steam hovered over an open meadow in the woods and the Headmaster assured Gawaine that under the steam he would find a dragon. Gawaine went forward slowly. He wondered whether it would be best to approach the dragon on the run as he did in his practice in the South Meadow or to walk slowly toward him, shouting "Rumplesnitz" all the way.</p>
          <p id="p_002567" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00009.smil#p_002567">The problem was decided for him. No sooner had he come to the fringe of the meadow than the dragon spied him and began to charge. It was a large dragon and yet it seemed decidedly aggressive in spite of the Headmaster's statement to the contrary. As the dragon charged it released huge clouds of hissing steam through its nostrils. It was almost as if a gigantic teapot had gone mad. The dragon came forward so fast and Gawaine was so frightened that he had time to say "Rumplesnitz" only once. As he said it, he swung his battle-ax and off popped the head of the dragon. Gawaine had to admit that it was even easier to kill a real dragon than a wooden one if only you said "Rumplesnitz."</p>
          <p id="p_002568" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00009.smil#p_002568">Gawaine brought the ears home and a small section of the tail. His schoolmates and the faculty made much of him, but the Headmaster wisely kept him from being spoiled by insisting that he go on with his work. Every clear day Gawaine rose at dawn and went out to kill dragons. The Headmaster kept him at home when it rained, because he said the woods were damp and unhealthy at such times and that he didn't want the boy to run needless risks. Few good days passed in which Gawaine failed to get a dragon. On one particularly fortunate day he killed three, a husband and a wife and a visiting relative. Gradually he developed a technique. Pupils who sometimes watched him from the hilltops a long way off said that he often allowed the dragon to come within a few feet before he said "Rumplesnitz." He came to say it with a mocking sneer. Occasionally he did stunts. Once when an excursion party from London was watching him he went into action with his right hand tied behind his back. The dragon's head came off just as easily.</p>
          <p id="p_002569" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00009.smil#p_002569">As Gawaine's record of killings mounted higher the Headmaster found it impossible to keep him completely in hand. He fell into the habit of stealing out at night and engaging in long drinking bouts at the village tavern. It was after such a debauch that he rose a little before dawn one fine August morning and started out after his fiftieth dragon. His head was heavy and his mind sluggish. He was heavy in other respects as well, for he had adopted the somewhat vulgar practice of wearing his medals, ribbons and all, when he went out dragon hunting. The decorations began on his chest and ran all the way down to his abdomen. They must have weighed at least eight pounds.</p>

            <span class="text" id="span_001561" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00009.smil#span_001561">Gawaine found a dragon in the same meadow where he had killed the first one. It was a fair-sized dragon, but evidently an old one. Its face was wrinkled and Gawaine thought he had never seen so hideous a countenance. Much to the lad's disgust, the monster refused to charge and Gawaine was obliged to walk toward him. He whistled as he went. The dragon regarded him hopelessly, but craftily. Of course it had heard of Gawaine. Even when the lad raised his battle-ax the dragon made no move. It knew that there was no salvation in the quickest thrust of the head, for it had been informed that this hunter was protected by an</span>

          <p id="p_002582" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00009.smil#p_002582">"Why, of course," exclaimed the dragon, "reactionary Republican."</p>
          <p id="p_002583" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00009.smil#p_002583">Gawaine shook his head.</p>
          <p id="p_002584" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00009.smil#p_002584">"Well, then," said the dragon, "we'd better get down to business. Will you surrender?"</p>
          <p id="p_002585" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00009.smil#p_002585">With the suggestion of a compromise Gawaine mustered up enough courage to speak.</p>
          <p id="p_002586" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00009.smil#p_002586">"What will you do if I surrender?" he asked.</p>
          <p id="p_002587" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00009.smil#p_002587">"Why, I'll eat you," said the dragon.</p>
          <p id="p_002588" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00009.smil#p_002588">"And if I don't surrender?"</p>
          <p id="p_002589" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00009.smil#p_002589">"I'll eat you just the same."</p>
          <p id="p_002590" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00009.smil#p_002590">"Then it doesn't mean any difference, does it?" moaned Gawaine.</p>
          <p id="p_002591" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00009.smil#p_002591">"It does to me," said the dragon with a smile. "I'd rather you didn't surrender. You'd taste much better if you didn't."</p>
          <p id="p_002592" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00009.smil#p_002592">The dragon waited for a long time for Gawaine to ask "Why?" but the boy was too frightened to speak. At last the dragon had to give the explanation without his cue line. "You see," he said, "if you don't surrender you'll taste better because you'll die game."</p>
          <p id="p_002593" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00009.smil#p_002593">This was an old and ancient trick of the dragon's. By means of some such quip he was accustomed to paralyze his victims with laughter and then to destroy them. Gawaine was sufficiently paralyzed as it was, but laughter had no part in his helplessness. With the last word of the joke the dragon drew back his head and struck. In that second there flashed into the mind of Gawaine the magic word "Rumples-nitz," but there was no time to say it. There was time only to strike and, without a word, Gawaine met the onrush of the dragon with a full swing. He put all his back and shoulders into it. The impact was terrific and the head of the dragon flew almost a hundred yards and landed in a thicket.</p>
          <p id="p_002594" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00009.smil#p_002594">Gawaine did not remain frightened very long after the death of the dragon. His mood was one of wonder. He was enormously puzzled. He cut off the ears of the monster almost in a trance. Again and again he thought to himself, "I didn't say 'Rumplesnitz'!" He was sure of that and yet there was no question that he had killed the dragon. In fact, he had never killed one so utterly. Never before had he driven a head for anything like the same distance. Twenty-five yards was perhaps his best previous record. All the way back to the knight school he kept rumbling about in his mind seeking an explanation for what had occurred. He went to the Headmaster immediately and after closing the door told him what had happened. "I didn't say 'Rumplesnitz,'" he explained with great earnestness.</p>
          <p id="p_002595" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00009.smil#p_002595">The Headmaster laughed. "I'm glad you've found out," he said. "It makes you ever so much more of a hero. Don't you see that? Now you know that it was you who killed all these dragons and not that foolish little word 'Rumplesnitz.'"</p>
          <p id="p_002596" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00009.smil#p_002596">Gawaine frowned. "Then it wasn't a magic word after all?" he asked.</p>
          <p id="p_002597" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00009.smil#p_002597">"Of course not," said the Headmaster, "you ought to be too old for such foolishness. There isn't any such thing as a magic word."</p>
          <p id="p_002598" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00009.smil#p_002598">"But you told me it was magic," protested Gawaine. "You said it was magic and now you say it isn't."</p>
          <p id="p_002599" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00009.smil#p_002599">"It wasn't magic in a literal sense," answered the Headmaster, "but it was much more wonderful than that. The word gave you confidence. It took away your fears. If I hadn't told you that, you might have been killed the very first time. It was your battle-ax did the trick."</p>
          <p id="p_002600" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00009.smil#p_002600">Gawaine surprised the Headmaster by his attitude. He was obviously distressed by the explanation. He interrupted a long philosophic and ethical discourse by the Headmaster with "If I hadn't of hit 'em all mighty hard and fast any one of 'em might have crushed me like a, like a----" He fumbled for a word.</p>
          <p id="p_002601" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00009.smil#p_002601">"Eggshell," suggested the Headmaster.</p>
          <pagenum id="p205" page="normal" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00009.smil#p205">205</pagenum>
          <p id="p_002602" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00009.smil#p_002602">"Like a eggshell," assented Gawaine, and he said it many times. All through the evening meal people who sat near him heard him muttering, "Like a eggshell, like a eggshell."</p>
          <p id="p_002603" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00009.smil#p_002603">The next day was clear, but Gawaine did not get up at dawn. Indeed, it was almost noon when the Headmaster found him cowering in bed, with the clothes pulled over his head. The principal called the Assistant Professor of Pleasaunce, and together they dragged the boy toward the forest.</p>
          <p id="p_002604" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00009.smil#p_002604">"He'll be all right as soon as he gets a couple more dragons under his belt," explained the Headmaster.</p>
          <p id="p_002605" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00009.smil#p_002605">The Assistant Professor of Pleasaunce agreed. "It would be a shame to stop such a fine run," he said. "Why, counting that one yesterday, he's killed fifty dragons."</p>
          <p id="p_002606" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00009.smil#p_002606">They pushed the boy into a thicket above which hung a meager cloud of steam. It was obviously quite a small dragon. But Gawaine did not come back that night or the next. In fact, he never came back. Some weeks afterward brave spirits from the school explored the thicket, but they could find nothing to remind them of Gawaine except the metal parts of his medals. Even the ribbons had been devoured.</p>
          <p id="p_002607" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00009.smil#p_002607">The Headmaster and the Assistant Professor of Pleasaunce agreed that it would be just as well not to tell the school how Gawaine had achieved his record and still less how he came to die. They held that it might have a bad effect on school spirit. Accordingly, Gawaine has lived in the memory of the school as its greatest hero. No visitor succeeds in leaving the building today without seeing a great shield which hangs on the wall of the dining hall. Fifty pairs of dragon's ears are mounted upon the shield and underneath in gilt letters is "Gawaine le C ur-Hardy," followed by the simple inscription, "He killed fifty dragons." The record has never been equaled.</p>

        <p id="p_002749" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00009.smil#p_002749">One winter there was a freezing rain. How beautiful! people said when things outside started to shine with ice. But the freezing rain kept coming. Tree branches glistened like glass. Then broke like glass. Ice thickened on the windows until everything outside blurred. Farmers moved their livestock into the barns, and most animals were safe. But not the pheasants. Their eyes froze shut.</p>
        <p id="p_002750" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00009.smil#p_002750">Some farmers went ice-skating down the gravel roads with clubs to harvest the pheasants that sat helplessly in the roadside ditches. The boys went out into the freezing rain to find pheasants too. They saw dark spots along a fence. Pheasants, all right. Five or six of them. The boys slid their feet along slowly, trying not to break the ice that covered the snow. They slid up close to the pheasants. The pheasants pulled their heads down between their wings. They couldn't tell how easy it was to see them huddled there.</p>
        <p id="p_002751" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00009.smil#p_002751">The boys stood still in the icy rain. Their breath came out in slow puffs of steam. The pheasants' breath came out in quick little white puffs. Some of them lifted their heads and turned them from side to side, but they were blindfolded with ice and didn't flush. The boys had not brought clubs or sacks, or anything but themselves. They stood over the pheasants, turning their own heads, looking at each other, each expecting the other to do something. To pounce on a pheasant, or to yell Bang! Things around them were shining and dripping with icy rain. The barbed-wire fence. The fence posts. The broken stems of grass. Even the grass seeds. The grass seeds looked like little yolks inside gelatin whites. And the pheasants looked like unborn birds glazed in egg white. Ice was hardening on the boys' caps and coats. Soon they would be covered with ice too.</p>
        <p id="p_002752" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00009.smil#p_002752">Then one of the boys said, Shh. He was taking off his coat, the thin layer of ice splintering in flakes as he pulled his arms from the sleeves. But the inside of the coat was dry and warm. He covered two of the crouching pheasants with his coat, rounding the back of it over them like a shell. The other boys did the same. They covered all the helpless pheasants. The small gray hens and the larger brown cocks. Now, the boys felt the rain soaking through their shirts and freezing. They ran across the slippery fields, unsure of their footing, the ice clinging to their skin as they made their way toward the blurry lights of the house.</p>

The last step in the process is to consider ways to publish or share your writing.

Other kinds of narrative include short stories, mysteries, movie scripts, television series, ballads, comic strips, histories, and journals. In this book you have examined many of the important elements and techniques of storytelling. Now you will have the chance to write your own narrative.</span>

The best-known fables are those attributed to Aesop, who is said to have lived around the sixth century B.C. The following fable of the tortoise and the hare is characteristic of Aesop's terse style and clearly stated moral:</span>

The hare sprinted out well ahead of the tortoise. Seeing how slow his adversary was, the hare became so confident that he relaxed and even lay down for a nap by the roadside. Meanwhile, the tortoise plodded on without stopping, passed the hare asleep on the road, and got to the finish line first. moral:</span>

La Fontaine took many of his stories from Aesop but translated them into verse. "The Fox and the Crow" is a fable that La Fontaine adapted from Aesop. Here a modern poet has translated the fable into English, preserving the wit and charm of La Fontaine's version:</p>

        <p id="p_003030" smilref="Adventures_in_Reading__Short00011.smil#p_003030">James Hurst's short story "The Scarlet Ibis" is told by an "I" who is one of the characters in the story. This narrator can reveal his own thoughts, of course, but he can report only what he thinks goes on in the minds of the other characters. Thus, we know only what the narrator tells us. Frank R. Stockton's short story "The Lady, or the Tiger?" is told by a third-person narrator. The author serves as an omniscient observer who steps outside the action of the story to address the reader.</p>

Inquiring if there will be others who have made the same trip (through life to death) and what welcome to expect, the traveler is assured of company and a ready greeting.

Suspense is greatest when it focuses attention on a sympathetic character. Thus, the most familiar kind of suspense involves a character hanging from the ledge of a tall building, or tied to railroad tracks as a train approaches, or ascending a staircase to open a suspicious door. But suspense may also arise simply from curiosity, as when a character must make an important decision, or seek an explanation for something.
