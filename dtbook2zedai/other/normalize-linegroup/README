Almost working demonstration of a way of unnesting linegroup/line elements.

The stylesheet tries to make sure that no linegroups are nested, no lines are nested,
that all lines have a linegroup as parent and that linegroups only has lines and
pagenums as children.

The stylesheet will probably make the document invalid and might remove some attributes,
so it should only be used in cooperation with other stylesheets, or as an example of
a solution to similar problems.
