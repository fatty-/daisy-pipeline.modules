            <h2>Version 0.7 (2010-10-15)</h2>
            <p>This release incorporates the following changes to the underlying Core Modules and features to simplify and improve markup models:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>the global <code>by</code> attribute was introduced for indicating the contributor of an element;</li>
                <li>the document production roles <code>author</code>, <code>editor</code>, <code>general-editor</code>, <code>translator</code>, <code>commentator</code> and <code>republisher</code> were added for use in the <code>by</code> attribute;</li>
                <li>the new <code>description</code> element was added for including and attaching accessible descriptions;</li>
                <li>the global <code>desc</code> attribute was added for referencing a <code>description</code> from any element in a document;</li>
                <li>the <code>object</code> element's content model has been changed to disallow nested objects;</li>
                <li>the children of the <code>object</code> element are considered an implicit description of the <code>object</code> unless an explicit <code>description</code> is embedded;</li>
                <li>the linking requirement for <code>note</code> and <code>annotation</code> have been changed so that either a <code>noteref</code> or <code>annoref</code> must point to them or they must point to some element in the document;</li>
                <li>new annotation roles were added for indicating changes to the layout, presentation and rendering of a document;</li>
                <li>the new annotation role <code>temporary</code> can be used to include production notes and other annotations not intended as part of a final document (and a schematron rule to generate warnings when present was also added);</li>
                <li>the <code>annoref</code> element was added for linking from a text referent to an annotation (similar to the existing <code>noteref</code> element).</li>
                <li>the <code>value</code> attribute has been added for noteref and annoref to include superscripted identifiers;</li>
                <li><code>glossary</code> entries assume an implicit association between their child <code>term</code> and <code>definition</code> when exactly one of each is present;</li>
                <li>added the new role <code>published-works</code> for identifying sections of works also by the same author;</li>
                <li>included a generalized version of the Content Rendering feature's <code>prefix</code> attribute for adding prefixes to any elements;</li>
                <li>the <code>sel:selid</code> attribute has been added to the Content Selection feature to handle multiple, identical ID values in condition branches;</li>
                <li>the XLink 1.1 schemas have been verified to be compliant with the formal Recommendation released May 6, 2010;</li>
                <li>the SSML 1.1 schemas have been verified to be compliant with the formal Recommendation released September 7, 2010;</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A functional XSD version of the schema is also now available. A complete translation from the RelaxNG source to XSD is not currently possible, however, so the XSD version should be used for authoring purposes only.</p>
